8,ItzFOBolous,t2_qfnxjcq,"Great post. I don't think Redditors realize how much the general public there support the government. Redditors want to think that the Chinese people are ""oppressed"" and ""brainwashed"" similar to North Korea but that's really not the case. Many of China's elite are educated in the West. Chinese companies also LOVES to hire people with a degree from American universities and/or with experience working for American companies. Those who have studied abroad also enjoy a level of prestige socially. For all its faults, the government has done an extraordinary job of rebuilding China and lifting people out of poverty. As long as the government there continues to make the lives of the average people better, the general public will continue to support the government and overlook its faults.

As the link you posted stated, it's not ""brainwashing"" per say. The current system of government in China is operating as how all imperial dynasties have operated for thousands of years.  As long as the good time continues, it will enjoy the people's support. As soon as the good time ends, the people who revolt and replace it with another autocracy that will promise a return of the good times. This is how the ""mandate of heaven"" work there throughout its entire history.

Chinese culture and society and does not have the foundation of freedom and ""people power"" our society in the West has. It's the opposite, actually (see Confusionism). People there don't share the same passion for ""people power"" people here has because there's no Cultural or historical foundation for it. To quote a popular saying there, ""nothing matters if I don't have rice on my bowl.""

The foundation for ""people power"" in Western society started in Athens, Greece and really cemented itself with the signing of the Magna Carta in the 1200s culminating and growing to the American Revolution and the society we have now. This historical and cultural foundation is why Democracies work so well in Western societies but fails in many other places (Middle East, Africa, ect).",1571111505,f3sx81a,t1_f3swde4,/r/rockets/comments/di0k50/marc_j_spears_i_believe_he_was_misinformed_and/f3sx81a/,1,rockets,comment

30,sohummm,t2_7bxrs,"What I see is three countries that do not want to be ruled by China and China suppressing any form of discussion about their form of government. It doesn't matter if Chinese people think that these places ""belong"" to them when the people actually living there think otherwise.

This is how most countries gain independence. They are ruled by some form of government that do not represent the interests of the people living there. Once the critical mass of people revolt / protest, it is up to the colonizing country to seriously consider freeing those people. The holding onto these countries with zero tolerance for discussion is just a sign that Chinese leadership is interested in parading their control rather than actually thinking about the interests of the people they are ""governing"".

The false equivalence of this colonialism-style defense of a conquered territory with other country's ""political/cultural taboo"" is most infuriating. China doesn't have some natural right to rule over the people living in the places known as Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan, just like the British didn't have a natural right to rule over India, Australia and all their colonies.

I bet Kerr's willing to take the backlash and all if China is angered....but he's a coach and looking at the Warriors roster, Klay and two other Warriors are signed by Anta, Steph has ties with China, etc. Maybe he was thinking about how his statements could affect other people. Idk. 

For me, it's different for Lebron because he is arguably the most influential and richest NBA player right now. He is a brand of his own and saying that Morey (YES, MOREY!) is *uneducated* is just something else. *Sigh*

Having said that tho, I still believe that the NBA as a whole should be firm about this. They need China more than China needs them. We shouldn't put the responsibility on select individuals, rather, the pressure to stand up for what's right should be on the institution that is the NBA.",1571126034,f3tb872,t1_f3t7sae,/r/rockets/comments/di18bz/is_this_your_king/f3tb872/,1,rockets,comment

however you also have to understand that this is the chinese way of recording history. otherwise they couldn't have maintained their precious title of ""5000 years of civilisation"".

apart from Qing Dynasty actually being the period the country is invaded by the Manchus, the Yuan Dynasty is actually the period when Genghis Khan (of Mongolia) ruled China (and half of the world). both Qing Dynasty and Yuan Dynasty are counted as part of the proud history of Chinese Dynasties.

Very dangerous to oppressors and dictators, yes.

You do know this whole thing was started by the Houston GM tweeting support for the protesters of Hong Kong, who are exercising their right to free speech that is being eroded by a brutal authoritarian regime, right?

Piss off with your equivocating - and by the way, your statement would likely still be protected under the First Amendment. [*Hess vs Indiana*](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/461/hess-v-indiana) states that advocating for an illegal action in the indefinite future, or advocating in a way that is unlikely to result in the commission of said action, is protected speech.

But LeBron has really cemented his legacy as a master on the court and a fool off it.  ""I am taking my talents to South Beach"" was Einsteinian compared to what he said yesterday.

How dare Daryl inconvenience him this way to say what he said why you were on your ""arduous"" road trip.  Didn't he know you were late for your massage appointment and could not be bothered with question about human dignity and something not related to your own narcissistic self-interest. 

That is what it comes down to by the way,  LeBron is so self-consumed and so self-absorbed, that anything outside of his narcissistic existence, even internment camps and live organ harvesting, is a trifle and a nuisance and how dare Morey convey this decency and commonly held view while King James had his kingly duties to attend to.",1571149731,f3tzjg8,t3_di18bz,/r/rockets/comments/di18bz/is_this_your_king/f3tzjg8/,1,rockets,comment

259,Agent78787,t2_9xdi4,"Fine deflection there, mate. The more things change, [the more they stay the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes).

Here's a relevant passage from Orwell:

&gt; An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the expression of a face. **The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is “just the same as” or “just as bad as” totalitarianism never take account of this fact. All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread.** In England [and America] such concepts as justice, liberty and objective truth are still believed in. They may be illusions, but they are very powerful illusions. The belief in them influences conduct, national life is different because of them. In proof of which, look about you. Where are the rubber truncheons, where is the castor oil? The sword is still in the scabbard, and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond a certain point. The English [and American] electoral system, for instance, is an all-but open fraud. In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in the interest of the moneyed class. But until some deep change has occurred in the public mind, it cannot become completely corrupt. You do not arrive at the polling booth to find men with revolvers telling you which way to vote, nor are the votes miscounted, nor is there any direct bribery.

For all of America's many faults, it is still a free country. For all of America's many faults, Americans submit secret ballots into boxes that aren't stuffed. For all of America's many faults, Americans can stand and shout for what they believe in without fear of getting teargassed only because they don't like the government, and read what they want on paper and online. America may conduct military operations foolishly and cruelly, but Americans can at least say those operations are foolish and cruel, and they can eventually change and stop them. None of that is true for the People's Republic of China. 

America is not a perfect country. It's not even a good country. But just as half a loaf of bread is not the same as no bread, the flaws of America do not make it comparable to the concentration-camp-operating, organ-harvesting, Hong-Kong-democracy-suffocating brutal dictatorship that is China.",1571152573,f3u47wt,t1_f3u2gw4,/r/rockets/comments/di2orw/astros_player_calls_out_lebron_stand_by_morey/f3u47wt/,1,rockets,comment

Why isn’t MLB, Apple, Chevy, Dodge, Levi’s, and so many others receiving the same criticism? Because no one really understands this topic and just wants to yell. Makes you feel good to think you’re morally superior, doesn’t it? But you aren’t. You’ve been supporting China and received economic benefits from its authoritarian government your whole life.

324,naughtyboy35,t2_k0x1c,"Yeah but that was under Mao. China started to flourish under Deng which used a completely different system. China was much poorer in the 1980s and Hong Kong was much richer nowadays China has grown so much that nobody gives a fuck about HK anymore. Shenzhen and Shanghai shits on HK all day. 

You need some economic lessons. HK is rich on paper yes, but majority of the wealth lies in the real estate monopoly. Average citizens pay millions to live in a 14 m^2 house. The despair and hopelessness of the HK youth is what led them to lash out their discontent in the first place. HK doesn’t have IT industry, manufacturing industry, resources, water, all of that comes from China? That’s why HK is so overpriced. 

Macau, you mean an irrelevant tourist hub that nobody cares. 

Taiwan, yes, a fake country that no country has embassy on. Nobody recognizes Taiwan as a country other than themselves. Countries are cutting ties with Taiwan to establish ties with China. Taiwan’s economy is bad, even HKers look down on them.

China was showing economic progress at that time. The students at Tiananmen are just like HK today, peaceful protests turned violent. They lynched soldiers and burned down armored trucks. Deng quickly suppressed the movement because it got violent. 30 years later, China became the world’s second largest economy and controls the US market completely. Trust me, we Chinese used to hate the CCP for doing that too. After Tiananmen a lot of people immigrated. However, nowadays our country has become so powerful we began to understand what our government did was for the greater good in the long term.

 As far as your attempt to whatabout Ferguson or LA, the obvious difference is that nobody was run over by a tank or disappeared.  Our cops stood trial, it was fucked up, and people protested.

By the way, the lives of vast majority of China have improved. There's no more mass starvation in China. Low-skilled workers are underpaid all over the world.

546,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,Nah—some of us feel aware of the HK situation as black-and-white including myself with business there and friends there but the timing and him as that sort of figure followed closely by many NBA fans in China was the perfect combustible mix. Not saying Daryl doesn’t have a burner (for fun) but just saying this scenario is not likely because there’s no reason for him to voice something controversial only to stay in the shadows. He is the type to chime in and folks like Kerr have had somewhat success chiming in—this seemed no different but it indeed was different—hence everyone has become hypersensitive and quiet lately while they try to normalize the controversy (whether that’s right or wrong is another issue).,1571054510,f3pcaih,t3_dhpanf,/r/rockets/comments/dhpanf/what_if_daryl_didnt_intent_to_blow_up_the_league/f3pcaih/,1,rockets,comment

Maybe had just been reading up on the situation, had a chance to tweet something out and just did it without taking time to weigh out the international implications.

When he realized the shit storm he quickly deleted it, after all... If he had planned out what a huge statement he was making in tweeting it, he would have surely left it up longer...

i think a bigger question is how will the rockets be treated? will the china stuff effect the way they are officiated, or treated around the NBA and media?

game wise the biggest question is on defense, will they be able to be good enough defensively that they will be able to hang with clippers. or maybe if their offense can be good enough that it doesn't matter.

I know for a fact that MDA is capable of making adjustments *in general*, as his teams in Houston look nothing like the teams he had in Phoenix... particularly in terms of pace.

As for in-game adjustments, I don't have access to what he tells the players... For all I know, he is trying to make adjustments but his team just can't or doesn't do them successfully.

What I do know for sure is that if something has been incredibly successful for a long time, that choosing the most critical moment of the season to ignore it and do something else seems like a pretty strange choice. If it works, things look great, but if it doesn't work either, then the second-guessing one's proven philosophy looks way waaayyy worse than the alternative.

736,ItzFOBolous,t2_qfnxjcq,"This situation IS complicated with lots of cultural and historical ramifications. It's not as easy as ""good vs evil."" Calling everyone who recognizes it a ""wumao"" and ""brainwashed"" is just ignorant.

I think part of the problem are the incredibly divergent viewpoints, how we in the West can look at Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan etc. as somehow ""apart"" from China, while everyone in China view these places as an integral and inseparable part of the Chinese identity. Call it brainwashing or whatever, but as strongly as we believe that every citizen should have a political voice, they believe that these places are an inseparable part of China, not necessarily the political identity but the cultural identity.

Just a quick explainer of how Chinese people view these places:

* Hong Kong - stolen via a war of aggression and unfair treaties.
* Taiwan - it would have been united with China except US chose to support the Kuomintang as their puppet in a world-wide ideological conflict against the USSR.
* Tibet - Conquered and absorbed as part of China since dynastic times. 800 years to be exact. Tibet has been part of Chinese history longer then the US has been a country. Tibet did gain defacto independence from 1912 to 1951. However, in the opinion of the Chinese, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed de facto independence when the Chinese nation was torn by warlordism, Japanese invasion, and civil war after the fall of Qing Dynasty. It is during this time that the Dali Lama tried to establish an independent theocracy.

External influence may have some effect, but barring some global catastrophe I personally feel a move away from authoritarianism can only spring from within. Honestly how China is ruled has not changed for couple thousand years, with strong reliance on ""enlightened dictator"" and the rule of ""the wise"" instead of rule of the law. The emphasis on personal connections for getting things done instead of codified processes is a cultural sticking point that literally hasn't changed for thousands of years. The introduction of communism basically got married to the parts of Chinese culture and philosophical thought that always had a deference to authority, stressing order and collective good over personal freedoms.

So for US people, hk protest is just a issue of freedom but for most chinese people, Hongkong problem is part of the territorial consistency of the whole country especially when some protestors wave UK and US national flags to protest.  In this sense, for mainland Chinese people, when a US business man, who earn money from China, openly supports 'the freedom of hong kong', it makes them recall the colonized experience happened before 1949 when the country's territory was carved up by the main capitalist countries in the world. This ""century of humiliation"" is why China reacts so defensively and forcefully when they feel like their territorial consistency is challenged.

You might think the Chinese people is brainwashed badly but every country has its political/cultural taboo no matter what reason creates this taboo.",1571106148,f3soi6s,t1_f3siits,/r/rockets/comments/di0k50/marc_j_spears_i_believe_he_was_misinformed_and/f3soi6s/,1,rockets,comment

767,jeychey,t2_14y74q,"I appreciate the long, thought-out argument you've drawn here, but that's besides the point. people take issue with how China generally conducts its business as an oppressive totalitarian regime, and Hong Kong is well within its rights to demand the retention of its civil liberties given that the two-governments-one-country system is something PRC *also* agreed to.

this is another case of opposing sides valuing different things and misunderstanding each other. if not for the videos of **police use of excessive force** and **China's history of making their dissenters disappear (cf. Tiananmen Square in '89, or basically Zedong's entire reign)**, this issue would probably not as big as it would be.

but as it stands, China seems to value its territory more than it values human lives. no matter the cultural context, that's highly immoral.

that's why pretty much nobody who 

1. doesn't have a vested capital interest in the market of China, or;
2. isn't mainland Chinese

sides with China. it's definitely deplorable for a lot of us, as their valuation of land and personal image over human rights (not even mentioning the current situation with Uighur Muslims) violates a lot of our moral principles.

perhaps the worst of all is when major American brands--both companies and individuals--kowtow to China in an attempt to save their dollars. I don't care how sensitive China is about their territory, because they haven't been very sensitive about other nations' lives and people either.

As for China respecting other countries, they actually follow a foreign policy of Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Chinese leadership originally enumerated these principles in 1954 when China, with a communist government, was trying to reach out to the non-communist countries of Asia.

Answer that you yourself don't have enough information to comment or 2.) Take a stance based on the information you have.   


Anyone with a brain/heart knows that China is committing human rights violations right and left. Anyone with freedom of speech/balls would take the stance that Morey did. Lebron said Morey was thinking about HIMSELF when he Tweeted what he did, but that is a lie. Morey was thinking about the people of Hong Kong and risking his livelihood to speak out in their defense. Lebron is now thinking about HIMSELF and siding with China to avoid risking his own livelihood.   


Being in the situation right now for a lot of these guys who represent the NBA does suck, and I feel bad for them, being pressured for soundbites. But it doesn't suck as bad as it does in Hong Kong right now, and that's what Morey had the balls to say that Lebron didn't.

You can see that as siding with China if you want. The NBA however is a business, not a human rights group. Not sure where the expectation is for them to speak is coming from. If that was the case, then they should be speaking up about the US too. We have a ton of problems in the US. We have cops killing innocent unarmed people and/or mass shootings more often than monthly.

1117,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"&gt; I think threes and layups are the best shots to take, but when you miss 7-10 threes in a row in a playoff game, you should probably throw a couple of mid ranges in to keep the defense honest. 

There are a few ideas things going on with this argument.

Firstly, if we're talking about the context where you are just cold from the 3 point line and not necessarily jacking up heavily contested 3s... MDA would still say that you have to let them shoot through it. Because of the nature of 3s being more variable of a shot compared to mid range shots, there will almost certainly be high points and low points. And the worst thing you can do as a 3 point shooting team is let a streak of  7 missed 3s in a row detur you from shooting more 3s, and as a coach you definitely shouldn't say ""if you miss X amount of 3s in a row, stop taking them and try to get easy baskets"" because that can mess with the confidence of a player. 

Now, if we're talking about a Gary Clark shooting situation where he's sub 30 from the field over the course of the whole season, yeah maybe let him get his percentage up before we let him just shoot 3s willy nilly. But people like Harden, Green, PJ, Gordon, even Westbrook. They should never be discouraged from taking good 3 point shots (relatively open ones).

Now, there is a second aspect of the original quote where if it's a case where you have a team like Utah that is defending the 3 really well, and defending the paint really well. Okay, in that case you might have to consider taking mid range jumpers. Although part of the problem with that is outside of Harden there are very few people on the team that can hit that shot with any level of efficiency. So I would probably try to run plays to get open 3s or get looks around the rim that even a guy like Gobert has a hard time defending.",1571010981,f3o8as3,t1_f3f84xe,/r/rockets/comments/dgq1er/how_exactly_is_it_better_to_force_a_3_or_drive/f3o8as3/,1,rockets,comment

1119,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"But I would say, even Harden in that situation where it's a pull up midrange shot... even if it's open. I don't know what the percentages are, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's a less than 50% shot for him. And at that point, you might as well just dribble out to the 3 point line (with only 1 defender on him) and go for the step back. Even semi-contested that's like a 33% shot at least for Harden.",1571011439,f3o8v93,t1_f3e5cj8,/r/rockets/comments/dgq1er/how_exactly_is_it_better_to_force_a_3_or_drive/f3o8v93/,1,rockets,comment

1506,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,If we say “forced” three pointer than the open midrange sounds better but I think the threes aren’t necessarily forced into a contested attempt but forced in terms of passing up open long 2’s. The analytics still sort out until there is a way to chase shooters off the line because it’s that pervasive then maybe the pendulum swings the other way.  It’s a cost-benefit analysis or risk based model in that the risk to take a three results in a higher probability of a better outcome (for example points per possession) than a open long two.

1539,713_Hou,t2_rk29a1b,"""Then simply answer the question. Which of the facts do you take issue with?"" I've already answered that. Simply learn basic reading comprehension.   
  
""You do realize there is a written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong, right? Check it again. You're objectively wrong."" Yes I am aware and I checked it before I said that, because unlike you I actually double check to make sure what i'm saying is correct and I'm not just spewing bullshit.  
  
My original comment on this thread: ""Apparently not wanting to more than double Ariza's salary makes him cheap""  
You respond: ""Not paying more than the minimum to replace the 3 rotation forwards he lost (Ariza, Luc, and Ryno) is what makes him cheap.""  
Me: ""So when a signing or trade doesn't work out it's Tilmans fault. But if Ennis or shumpert (who didn't make the minimum by the way) had turned out to be good additions something tells me you wouldn't have given him any of the credit.""   
you: ""When Tilman not only doesn't let Morey upgrade the roster, but actively makes the roster worse because of his ""no- repeater-tax"" decree...""  SO LIKE I SAID, YOU were the first one to bring up Morey. Check it again.  
  
""???"" Reading is not hard, and as you said there's a record of these things so you can go back and check if you don't get it.  
  
  
""That ROLE (big forward) was never properly replaced"" But that isn't reason enough to say Fuck Tilman and say he is sabotaging the team. That's a massive overreaction, and as I keep saying. Morey needs to bare the majority of blame for that. The cost cutting deadline moves came when we were fighting for 5th, Morey could have got a better replacement before the season started.   
"" I fault that as the reason we had more problems"" So the main problems last year were what? injuries, Capella struggling in the playoffs, everyone but Harden having a slow start, House holding out? If all 3 of them stayed. there would still be injuries, capella would have still struggled in the playoffs, House might not have ever been called up so i guess that's a problem gone. As for slow start, over the first qtr of last season Ariza averaged 9.7/5.5/3.3 and ryno had 3.7/3.0/1.1 and Luc was injured. So not exactly lighting it up.
""BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's"" No, you really shouldn't. A) because Ariza wouldn't be 33 again, Luc wouldn't be healthy again, and Anderson never regained his pre injury form, thats why he barely played in the playoffs. There is zero reason to assume that he would regain that form in 2019 when he couldn't do it in 2018. B) Why would I use their 2019 salary hits, judged off their 2018 production?  
  
""You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? "" I could misunderstanding this, but he's still listed with the $7mil in incentives, which I was under the impression counted towards matching salaries. Maybe they just didn't update it after whatever the nba ruling was, but I checked a few salary tracking websites and it's still listed. So this could be on me, but I doubt it. Although this is meaningless, there are players that actually do make the minimum on the roster.  
  
""Then explain how they aren't."" What comment is it you think I'm not addressing? I've looked through this multiple times and I have no clue what you're referring to.   
  
""I will emphasize again (since you seem to no understand my point) that the issue was not in retaining those players. The issue was not using Ryno's contract (or the MLE) to replace the role."" Ryno's role is to shoot 3s. He's not a rebounder, despite the height, or a good defender. We don't need to add anyone to get more 3s off, just play Gordon and Gerald more, which we did. plus House, Ennis, Rivers shot well.",1570860749,f3e72xp,t1_f3dv2h1,/r/rockets/comments/ded55z/why_is_everyone_hating_tillman/f3e72xp/,1,rockets,comment
1540,FarWestEros,t2_b40e0aj,"I will address other parts of your response later, but for now just give simple yes/no answers to whether or not you agree with these facts (the comment you can't seem to locate):

1)We were very close to winning in 2018.

2)Most teams would go ""all-in"" in those circumstances and try to upgrade the roster however possible.

3a) The MLE and Ryno's contract were our only way to upgrade the roster without moving core players in trades, but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax.

3b) 23 of the 32 Finals teams in the tax-paying era have paid luxury tax (and 12 of 16 Champions).

4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling {*forwards 6'8"" or taller*} and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)...

5) Iman Shumpert (who had played guard virtually his entire career up to that point due at least in part to being 'small' by league standards), who was the only player to emerge from Ryno's contract after all the dealing was done, and is not likely to be signed this season.

So of those facts, where do you disagree?",1570861410,f3e7jz7,t1_f3e72xp,/r/rockets/comments/ded55z/why_is_everyone_hating_tillman/f3e7jz7/,1,rockets,comment

1552,YnwaMquc2k19,t2_3uay5vwd,"I lived In China for a bit when I was a kid (early 2000s).

Back than my uncle loved to wake up early in the morning and watch China’s version of Sportscenter, and I clearly remember that back then the intro was filled with montages from Yao Ming and the Rockets by majority. The soundtrack for the intro was Rocket Man by Elton John. I didn’t know Elton back then but I thought the song was beautiful to listen to in the early morning. 

I became a casual Rockets and NBA fan because I really like Yao Ming - not just because his Chinese, but also his sense of humour (he said that his favourite song was the American anthem because he listens to it 82 times during the season) and his playing style. When he retired in 2011 due to a long term injury I feel a bit sad. I thanked my uncle for exposing me to NBA and Basketball both as a sport to play and a sport to spend your pastime watching.

With all that said, I think that the recent controversy between Rockets and China should not have happened. What I mean is that The Morey tweet could have been a great window for young Chinese fans to truly understand what’s going on in HK with a more objective and critical lens, but the way the government and certain Chinese fans on the Internet handled it really disappointed me. But I guess to a majority of you it’s a blessing in disguise since it exposed to you a lot of the dark stuff that’s going on in China. I feel bad that this turned out that way because there are a lot of people in China who simply wants to enjoy basketball, the Rockets and the NBA, and now they got stuck in a hard place.

1586,FarWestEros,t2_b40e0aj,"&gt;""Then simply answer the question. Which of the facts do you take issue with?"" I've already answered that. Simply learn basic reading comprehension.

Answer my first response directly then. Yes or no. If yes, you need say nothing more, but if you want to express the issue you have with any ""no"", then please be explicit about which words or phrases you take issue with and whether or not you agree with the other aspects... Maybe even provide an alternate ""fact"" as you see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""You do realize there is a written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong, right? Check it again. You're objectively wrong."" Yes I am aware and I checked it before I said that, because unlike you I actually double check to make sure what i'm saying is correct and I'm not just spewing bullshit.

Okay, my bad... You're right on that one. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My original comment on this thread: ""Apparently not wanting to more than double Ariza's salary makes him cheap""You respond: ""Not paying more than the minimum to replace the 3 rotation forwards he lost (Ariza, Luc, and Ryno) is what makes him cheap.""Me: ""So when a signing or trade doesn't work out it's Tilmans fault. But if Ennis or shumpert (who didn't make the minimum by the way) had turned out to be good additions something tells me you wouldn't have given him any of the credit.""you: ""When Tilman not only doesn't let Morey upgrade the roster, but actively makes the roster worse because of his ""no- repeater-tax"" decree...""  SO LIKE I SAID, YOU were the first one to bring up Morey. Check it again.

I was responding incorrectly to:

""Ok if that's how it goes down, than Morey is the one suggesting we sign Ennis or whoever, **yet you give him 0% of the blame**. But if its Austin Rivers Fertita signs off on, **You give Morey 100% of the credit**. **THAT is the issue**. That is the point. Not any of the other paragraphs of bullshit you typed.""

This bugs in a way bigger way than me dropping his name once in a peripheral example and then forgetting about it (because it was so inconsequential to my main point I hadn't put any mental focus whatsoever on it).

You assert ""THAT is the issue""... But it's not... It's not even close to the issue... I'm not even considering it on any level and if you want to say Morey is to blame, too, then I'm all for it. I've said many times on this sub that it is the biggest mistake of his tenure (Tbf, he's got a new one now... bad streak for him).

But the point is that in this thread I had never credited Morey one way or the other, and even if I had, it is FAR from ""the issue"". The issue is that our team is getting worse and that it is because we are actively making it worse in an effort to avoid the tax. And Tilman very publicly threatened Morey's job security if he paid too much tax. So it's a pretty clear connection that Morey would try to cut costs to keep him happy. And Tilman has been rubber-stamping it every step of the way... As opposed to suggesting we actually maximize our Championship chances by paying for some depth to provide James with the best roster possible (or at least a second playable forward).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""???"" Reading is not hard, and as you said there's a record of these things so you can go back and check if you don't get it.

You say it's ""weird"". 

How is it weird? It makes perfect sense to compare 2019 to 2018 to see how the roster was affected under his leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""That ROLE (big forward) was never properly replaced"" But that isn't reason enough to say Fuck Tilman and say he is sabotaging the team. 

Well, I never said either of those things (my response is much more muted as I understand it is his team to do with as he pleases)... but sure it is. Way more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's a massive overreaction, 

No it's not. Harden's prime is ticking away and we just wasted an MVP-level season.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and as I keep saying. Morey needs to bare the majority of blame for that. The cost cutting deadline moves came when we were fighting for 5th, Morey could have got a better replacement before the season started.

I wish he had, and yeah... he screwed up last off-season, too, but the trade deadline was the most critical moment, because as Morey assured us many times, it's not the team you have in October, but the one in March that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" I fault that as the reason we had more problems"" So the main problems last year were what? injuries, Capella struggling in the playoffs, everyone but Harden having a slow start, House holding out? If all 3 of them stayed. 

Imma stop you right there. I've said multiple times that I don't fault letting them go... I fault not replacing the role. I thought we were looking for an upgrade, but apparently they were fine with downgrading if it meant a better bottom line.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;there would still be injuries, capella would have still struggled in the playoffs, House might not have ever been called up so i guess that's a problem gone. As for slow start, over the first qtr of last season Ariza averaged 9.7/5.5/3.3 and ryno had 3.7/3.0/1.1 and Luc was injured. So not exactly lighting it up. ""BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's"" No, you really shouldn't. A) because Ariza wouldn't be 33 again, Luc wouldn't be healthy again, and Anderson never regained his pre injury form, thats why he barely played in the playoffs. There is zero reason to assume that he would regain that form in 2019 when he couldn't do it in 2018. B) Why would I use their 2019 salary hits, judged off their 2018 production?  
&gt;  
&gt;""You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? "" I could misunderstanding this, but he's still listed with the $7mil in incentives, which I was under the impression counted towards matching salaries. 

Those only count if he hits games played thresholds (he won't unless we are really searching to pay him more... We have 3-5 other center possibilities) at the end of the year and he needs to be on a 52-win team for them to kick in. He will be waived by mid-February or the second year kicks in. And it won't be by us. The only question is if he will be traded for something or nothing. But if it's something, it won't be a big something unless he's combined with other players.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe they just didn't update it after whatever the nba ruling was, but I checked a few salary tracking websites and it's still listed. So this could be on me, but I doubt it.

lol 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Although this is meaningless, there are players that actually do make the minimum on the roster.

Yeah. Your point?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Then explain how they aren't."" What comment is it you think I'm not addressing? I've looked through this multiple times and I have no clue what you're referring to.

So yeah, before you reply to any of the pointless bullcrap in this comment, go back and give the Yes/No answers to the 5 facts... They are critical to the actual point... unlike 'who typed the word ""Morey"" first'.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I will emphasize again (since you seem to no understand my point) that the issue was not in retaining those players. The issue was not using Ryno's contract (or the MLE) to replace the role."" Ryno's role is to shoot 3s. He's not a rebounder, despite the height, or a good defender. We don't need to add anyone to get more 3s off, just play Gordon and Gerald more, which we did. plus House, Ennis, Rivers shot well.

Note that none of the guys you mentioned ever spent time as our small-ball 5.

Despite what you think...

1590,H-TownDown,t2_9a8i8d0,"I think threes and layups are the best shots to take, but when you miss 7-10 threes in a row in a playoff game, you should probably throw a couple of mid ranges in to keep the defense honest. I think that a healthy shot diet in the playoffs  is something like 30-35 threes (unless you’re hot. Then shoot more than that), 30-35 shots at the rim, and 5-15 mid ranges (almost none when the team is hot from three and more than a hand full for when they aren’t hot from three). The way teams defend us, mid ranges are open shots. Math doesn’t matter nearly as much in the playoffs due to the small sample size.

2071,binger5,t2_9swxl,"/r/houston has a good sidebar for stuff to do and places to eat in Houston. You should check that out. 

Space center Houston has a level 9 tour that's suppose to be awesome. I haven't been, but everyone raves about it. 

You should look into renting a car if you can because Houston is very spaced out and public transportation is not very good. Ubering 30 minutes to a place and 30 minutes back adds up very quickly. NASA is about a 30 minute to 1 hour drive from downtown depending on traffic. 

Downtown/Midtown are good places to stay. It's close enough to most places and you can walk to bars and restaurants. Other locations are going to be iffy.

As for Kerr and the rest of the NBA goes, I don't blame them for caring about issues close to home and feeling apathy towards issues in other countries.

Before all this, did you even know about Hong Kong? Did you speak up for Hong Kong? Against India for Kashmir and for IIraq, both of which just experienced their own Tiananmen Square-esque incidences? Did you speak and take action against Duerte in the Philippines or against Spain for Catalan when Spain crushed their popular independence movement? Or against France when they cracked down on the Yellow Vest movement the way China is cracking down in Hong Kong

The answer? No. Don't lie. You haven't heard of most of them. The incidences you vaguely heard about, you didn't care enough to find out more. The ones you do know about, you didn't care enough to do anything about. Because those are problems in counties far away that doesn't affect us. And you're not going to start now.

You know what effects us? Trump wanting to be like Xi and trying to turn us into his personal China. And that's why the speak out about these issues.

The only reason you and your T_D buddies supposedly ""care"" now because you're mad at Kerr, Pop, LeBron, ect cause they speak out against your Dear Leader often and this is your way of getting back at them.",1570818287,f3c0exa,t1_f3bifvl,/r/rockets/comments/dghco2/steve_kerr_is_a_coward/f3c0exa/,1,rockets,comment

Same goes for the question asked to Harden and WB by that reporter. It was about feeling comfortable about voicing their opinions in the future because of the NBA's recent statement.

Nazi concentration camps:

* rounded up and imprisoned against their will
* German citizens based on ethnicity
* neither committed, nor were involved in, any crimes
* starved
* systematically murdered
* never released nor ever planned to be released, i.e. the situation was permanent until their deaths

Migrant detainment centers:

* choose to cross the border ill, knowing that they would be detained while legal status was sorted
* not citizens of the United States of America
* committed, or were involved in, a crime by virtue of illegal border crossing
* well fed
* not murdered, well treated
* situation is temporary, and they will be released once legal status is sorted, either returned to home nation or allowed to enter America

2261,713_Hou,t2_rk29a1b,"""(and no... they don't even come close to proving my point wrong, either). Hence why I brought things back to the point."" Except regardles of your refusal to admit it, they absolutely prove your point wrong.  You can't say ""fertita won't go into the luxary tax, that's costing us. Bring back Les"" When A) Les only went into the Tax twice. and B) the issue wasn't the lucary tax, it's the repeater tax.  
""What are you talking about here?"" You can pretend that you were talking about 2017/18, but when you spend 80% of the time complaining about Shumpert and Ennis or how we didn't replace luc and Ariza...
  

""Fertitta signs off on all major moves and we know this from interviews with him"" Signs off on. It's still Morey that is scouting, choosing, negotiating with for all the players. Morey is still in control of the franchise. But You are blaming Fertita for not replacing players to your liking. Fertita just sings the checks, which despite what you want to believe, are far larger than they were when Les owned the team.  
  
""Again. It's just a fact. I want to know if you agree or not. Although I guess I should ask you... Are you aware that paying the luxury tax last year would not have meant paying the repeater tax until possibly the 2022 season?"" Yes I'm aware. That's why I kept saying Avoid and delay the repeaters tax. We're already over the cap now, chances are we're paying it this year
  
""Use your line-up checker to see how often they played PF for us. Coming from the person who is trying to call Shumpert a suitable Forward replacement, this is laughable."" Ariza played 30% of his minutes at pf. Shumpert played 85% of his minutes at foward last year. What's laughable is that you cant fathom calling Shumpert anything but the position he spend 15% of his minutes at, but heaven forbid I call our starting small foward for half a decade a small forward.  
  
The 10 most used lineups with Mbah a Moute on the floor:  
Paul/Harden/Luc/Tucker/Capella: 130 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Capella: 73 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 62 minutes  
Paul/Harden/Luc/Anderson/Capella:58: minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Ariza/Luc/Capella: 55 Minutes
Harden/Ariza/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 56 Minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Anderson/Capella: 47 Minutes  
Harden/Ariza/Luc/Tucker/Capella:38 minutes  
Paul/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 32 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Anderson: 30 Minutes
  
So out of one of those lineups, He was the PF for 55 minutes, but since according to you Ariza was a pf, you might argue that Luc was actually playing the 3 in that lineup too. But sure, it's laughable.  
  
  
""Source?"" Just look up the starting lineups from his first year in Pheonix. How is a 6'6"" guy playing at guard so unbelievable to you that you need a source for that of all things?  
  
""If Morey brings him several options of trade targets,"" Ok if that's how it goes down, than Morey is the one suggesting we sign Ennis or whoever, yet you give him 0% of the blame. But if its Austin Rivers Fertita signs off on, You give Morey 100% of the credit. THAT is the issue. That is the point. Not any of the other paragraphs of bullshit you typed.  
  
""But again... the point is just to clarify that we turned Ryan Anderson's $20M contract into Shumpert and nothing else (and maybe we should throw in cost to do it? I believe it ended up being a first, a second or two, and Melton, right?)"" are you suggesting that I liked that trade or thought it was a good idea? because I hated that trade at the time, and I hated it more when the suns were able to get more for Ryno than we did. But again, the point of this whole thing is you give all the blame of this to Fertita, when Morey is the one actually negotiating the deals. That's just laughable.",1570835376,f3de2zu,t1_f3a5i8t,/r/rockets/comments/ded55z/why_is_everyone_hating_tillman/f3de2zu/,1,rockets,comment

It’s not up to us or anyone not from China to worry about that, let their country develop on their own.

Note: your new definition of power forward means our starting power forward isn't a power forward.  
  
Note 2: ""Not sure why you are bringing him now"" I'm not bringing him in now. Actually you were the first one to mention Morey, and his name has been mentioned dozens of times since then. but thanks for confirming your lack of reading comprehension.  
  
Note 3: ""Tilman took over the team in the 2018 season. That is why I'm using it as the baseline comparison for what he has done"" Weird how you would use not replacing Ryno, Luc, and Ariza as your main complaint against him then considering that happened for the 2019 season then.  
  
""We had the best team in the league and he has systematically worsened it through personnel decisions"" So based on the 3 decisions you claim as the example of him systematically worsening the team. Ariza was/is on the decline, Losing him is not a big deal. Luc, and I cant stress this enough, PLAYED 4 GAMES LAST YEAR. Another big whoop. And Anderson averaged 2.5/2.2/0.8 last year. But no you're right, Not paying them a combined $35+ million is the reason we didn't win the title. Because Luc setting on the bench in a suit would have somehow made Clint not forget how to play basketball. Ariza being here would have kept cp3 healthy. And we all know Ryno was the missing piece to beating the warriors.   
  
Note 4: Nene was signed as a trade asset, to help match salary. You understand there will be salary coming back right?    
  
  ""going back to my comment a few comments ago, just indicate which of the facts (with number 4's revision to height accounted for""

""4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling PFs and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)...""
Not paying $35+ million (not including the tax hit) for a combined 15/7.6/4.5 isn't being cheap. It's common sense. And again, your acting like Fertita forced Morey into making those moves. When I would hope for the sake of the team that morey is smart enough to know that they are not worth nearly that much. Paul George and Kawhi leonard don't even make $35mil, and they have slightly more production than 14/7.6 and 4.5.",1570844559,f3dr1u0,t1_f3djf9b,/r/rockets/comments/ded55z/why_is_everyone_hating_tillman/f3dr1u0/,1,rockets,comment

2305,FarWestEros,t2_b40e0aj,"&gt; I haven't evaded anything.

Then answer the question. Which of the facts do you take issue with

&gt; Note: your new definition of power forward means our starting power forward isn't a power forward.

Can you get past the labels for a minute? I already said I'm fine with going by height instead of label.

&gt; Note 2: ""Not sure why you are bringing him now"" I'm not bringing him in now. Actually you were the first one to mention Morey, and his name has been mentioned dozens of times since then. but thanks for confirming your lack of reading comprehension.

You do realize there is a written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong, right? Check it again. You're objectively wrong.

&gt; Note 3: ""Tilman took over the team in the 2018 season. That is why I'm using it as the baseline comparison for what he has done"" Weird how you would use not replacing Ryno, Luc, and Ariza as your main complaint against him then considering that happened for the 2019 season then.

#???

This *is* my main complaint against him... what do you think I'm trying to say?


&gt; ""We had the best team in the league and he has systematically worsened it through personnel decisions"" So based on the 3 decisions you claim as the example of him systematically worsening the team. Ariza was/is on the decline, Losing him is not a big deal. Luc, and I cant stress this enough, PLAYED 4 GAMES LAST YEAR. Another big whoop. And Anderson averaged 2.5/2.2/0.8 last year. But no you're right, Not paying them a combined $35+ million is the reason we didn't win the title. Because Luc setting on the bench in a suit would have somehow made Clint not forget how to play basketball. Ariza being here would have kept cp3 healthy. And we all know Ryno was the missing piece to beating the warriors.

That **ROLE** (big forward) was never properly replaced, and yes, I fault that as the reason we had more problems. I have no problem with letting those particular players go. I have a problem with not filling the role (BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's)

&gt; Note 4: Nene was signed as a trade asset, to help match salary. You understand there will be salary coming back right?

You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? We can do with him the same thing we did with Melo and MCW last year... send him and some cash off to another team for a heavily protected second rounder that we will never receive in order to avoid him appearing on our salary obligations 

&gt; ""going back to my comment a few comments ago, just indicate which of the facts (with number 4's revision to height accounted for"" I don't disagree with facts, you just not stating facts.

Then explain how they aren't. You did a fine job with that regarding ""PF"" so I altered the fact to talk about the player's height instead.

&gt; ""4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling PFs and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)..."" Not paying $35+ million (not including the tax hit) for a combined 15/7.6/4.5 isn't being cheap. It's common sense. And again, your acting like Fertita forced Morey into making those moves. When I would hope for the sake of the team that morey is smart enough to know that they are not worth nearly that much. Paul George and Kawhi leonard don't even make $35mil, and they have slightly more production than 14/7.6 and 4.5.

I will emphasize again (since you seem to no understand my point) that the issue was not in retaining those players. The issue was not using Ryno's contract (or the MLE) to replace the role.",1570847897,f3dv2h1,t1_f3dr1u0,/r/rockets/comments/ded55z/why_is_everyone_hating_tillman/f3dv2h1/,1,rockets,comment

2514,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"&gt; Everyone stands to lose money, refs included.  

\-In what way? I'm like 99% sure that the refs won't lose ANY money from what went down in China. They relatively cheap labor compared to Coaches, Players, Owners and other High Level Team employees. And their salary isn't tied to the salary cap. There is no way the NBA would tie their salaries to what the NBA makes as a whole.

In general there is no way the Rockets would lose because of the games being fixed , for multiple reasons:

\-In order to make the Rockets lose games, you need to fix said games. Which means not just 1 ref, multiple refs at the very least. And because above we've already established that refs have ABSOLUTELY 0 motivation to want to fix games for any specific team (out side of them having money on the other team) that means likely the motivation would have to come from somewhere else. It would have to be someone like Adam Silver who both hypothetically could control refs in some way and someone who lost something big due to what went down with this whole China mess. 

\-Lets say for the sake of argument that it's even possible to somewhat coordinate with a bunch of refs and effectively fix several games against the Rockets (it probably isn't but might as well not even try to argue that point). It definitely will be hard to fix these games without any evidence being left that is easy to find or any whistleblowers or anyone suddenly noticing the officiating being unusually bad against the Rockets.

\-Fixing games against the Rockets in the regular season will have very little effect unless we're talking about close to a 8 games at least. If it's only like 4 games, that maybe knocks them down from the 2nd seed to the 5th maybe. But that seems like a lot of work to be doing and risking your career just for so little effect. And once you get past 8 games, the more chance people figure it out (as pointed out in above point).

\-And finally, this final point was kind of implied the whole time with the past few points but it still bears restating. If Silver were to get caught, at the very least loses his job. Dude has only been Commish for a few years and so I doubt he has the capital with the owners to survive such a scandal. Especially if it happens after the China debacle. 

&amp;#x200B;

So all of those reasons are reasons why it wouldn't happen. But on top of that, there are probably ways someone like Silver (or any 1 person) could get back at Morey and/or the Rockets that are less risky but are just as effective. 

\-Fix a game yes, but have it be only 1 game. Have it be a playoff game. There is obviously a bigger chance for 1 win or loss against a tough opponent (even if it was game 1) to be the difference in making it out of the series. 

\-Drug James Harden before an important game so that he is less effective. And while we are making jokes... kidnapping/killing Rockets players too would accomplish the same goal but would be less risky than a conspiracy formed with refs to fix a bunch of Rockets games. Hell... since he has an issue with Morey, seems like going straight to the source and offing Morey would be the best revenge.",1570681179,f35lcxw,t3_dfs22u,/r/rockets/comments/dfs22u/the_only_way_i_see_this_saga_ending/f35lcxw/,1,rockets,comment

2520,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"Eh... it's possible. 

Part of the issue too is that the Wolves don't necessarily need to get rid of cap room. They aren't even in luxury tax land yet. And it doesn't really make sense for them to offload salary with the purposes of getting under the cap because they won't be under it enough to do anything interesting anyway. Dieng's deal ends after 2020-2021 season. Meaning it will be an expiring for next season making it much easier to deal away if they wanted to. 

Actually, it seems like the most likely way Covington is involved in a deal as a means to shed salary is if Andrew Wiggins' salary is involved. He's looking at making around 30 millionish for the next 4 years. If you realize this season it obviously isn't working with him and Towns.

1) We were very close to winning in 2018.

2) Most teams would go ""all-in"" in those circumstances and try to upgrade the roster however possible.

3a) The MLE and Ryno's contract were our only way to upgrade the roster without moving core players in trades, but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax.

3b) 23 of the 32 Finals teams in the tax-paying era have paid luxury tax (and 12 of 16 Champions). 

4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling PFs and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)...

5) Iman Shumpert (who had played guard virtually his entire career up to that point due at least in part to being 'small' by league standards), who was the only player to emerge from Ryno's contract after all the dealing was done, and is not likely to be signed this season.

As a patriot and a decent human being he’s sacrificing human rights and democratic values. Score = fuck that shit dude. 

Let’s take this from two perspectives. 

Scenario 1: I’m a young salesperson from a poor background trying to support my family. I have a big deal from China being worked on that could elevate my station in life. Am I going to let human rights and democratic values get in the way of that?  Probably not if we’re being honest. Sad but true. 

Scenario 2: I’m a billionaire. I’ll be okay if China tells me to fuck off. I should tell them to fuck off.

Harden is better on ball than Westbrook is, but Harden has more off ball skills than Westbrook does. Harden needs to compromise for this to work.

2822,PM_ME_InteriorDesign,t2_417rr73y,"I just downvoted your comment.

# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",1570713510,f36k6ne,t1_f35ae79,/r/rockets/comments/debtgl/we_have_to_make_it_known_that_if_tillman_sides/f36k6ne/,1,rockets,comment

Rockets beat writers have been talking about his timings being off because he couldn’t play 5vs5 at all during rehab. In his second game his passes were still somewhat inaccurate for his standards but still an improvement from his first game. Offense will be fine, rebounding on the other hand....

No, we don't.

Not saying something rude for no particular reason is not the same as self-censorship. You're setting up a false equivalency.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It's not his job, nor will it ever be his job to make political commentary

Political discourse is the ""job"" of every American citizen. Anyone that is actually paid to be a political commentator is chiefly concerned with making money and is beholden to their corporate masters, not actually expressing themselves freely.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Maybe he speaks for you

You're completely missing the point. This censorship sets a dangerous precedent and has a wider reach than just the NBA. Look at the recent debacle at Blizzard. Or in Hollywood.

2888,nonetimeaccount,t2_3kug0,"Offense is unreal. We ain't even clicking yet but you can see we're going to be even more exciting this year. We shot like dog shit from 3 but remained neck and neck with the raps. 

Russ is looking pretty good from what I can see. He's already erased the mid-range from his game which is really impressive considering how much he has relied on it and it's only his 2nd game. He looks smooth from the ft line too. If he gets that back to career averages his ts% gets a very nice boost. 

Still very concerned about the defense. We did a better job of not getting caught on doubles leaving a wide open dunker, but we still gave up way too many open 3s. We have real trouble once a play starts breaking down or in to scrambles and improv. Hopefully in time with consistent rotations and guys learning their spots better this won't carry on, but it looks like our biggest weakness to me right now.

Very happy with the roster depth.

we all know Harden doesn't mean it in that environment. Actually, you don't know what china is. I am chinese and i dont know exactly Uyghur and Tibet history events. China goverment did something bad i think in history. Which goverment is clean in history or even now? US? And it is not related to the Morey's  problem.

Come to china to take a look if you have chance in the future. Don't believe cnn/bcc. Public Media is the worst thing in the world including china media. Uyghur, Tibet and all other  Minority group (china has 56  Nationality) has more rights . China has lots of problems ..but we dont have racism problem.  

Morey can speak china is not good, china has lots of pollution, china is not good to help poors, chinese is not good at basketball etc.  Nobody will diss him.  The only thing he can't speak is hongkong/taiwan problem.  It is the same as racism in your country.

3026,jackshenknows,t2_2genxd3n,"I m a Chinese here and I do agree with you on the part that supporting democracy is not the same as being racist. But it is not as simple as you said. I went to their website [https://standwithhk.org/](https://standwithhk.org/). their top agenda is to urge China to honor the 1984 agreement with Britain which grantees hongkong 50yrs of high degree autonomy. While I totally think it is reasonable, the protest has evolved into violent demonstration which even involves burning Chinese banks and Chinese electronic stores, painting separatism words at the stores they looted, check these photos by CNN [https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/asia/hong-kong-protest-migration-intl-hnk/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/asia/hong-kong-protest-migration-intl-hnk/index.html). Clearly some people within the protest group are trying to do actual damage or even represent separatism, which goes way back since the handover in 1997. Nobody within the protest group is taking responsibilities or make a statement for any of these damages, and hence it is impossible for Chinese government to actually open a channel for dialogue with them. And at this very moment Morey, the GM of the most beloved NBA team, posted support for the movement. What do you think China will do? The government can't distinguish who within the protest group is benevolent and who are the violent ones because they all claim to be under the same agenda, so the only thing they can do is to show strength by asking for an apology, at least say sorry for posting without knowing the whole truth; but nobody in the US was listening, everybody just standing at the moral highground and bashing us, we are deeply hurt.

I love NBA, been a die hard Rocket fan for over a decade, went through thick and thin with HTown basketball; but like the dude before you said, separatism has brought too much pain and blood to us in the past thousands of years, we have to stand together.

You’re right— Harden jumps off his left leg (his strong side). I’m jumping off my strong side as well. I noticed even though it is opposite of how you would conventionally lay-up (e.g., jump off left leg for right handed lay-ups) it gives more alignment and base going up from that foot into the shot and I’ve gotten very used to it.

I doubt every one is about the same magnitude in intelligence. If it was the case, communication would have been way easier, but that is beside the point.

Only because we can't read each others minds, we should try our best to communicate with others in a meaningful way. I am not disallowing anyone's freedom of speech. But I am judging whether this person's actions were productive to his goal, assuming that his goal was to highlight the problem with freedom of speech(banning Houston Rockets). With his actions he only managed to aggravate his fellow countrymen and nobody cared about his message. So the results suggest that burning a flag, or attempting to burn a flag, is not the most useful thing to do when you are trying to protest in China. Not only in China, but anywhere on a globe I imagine. What does it accomplish? You may dislike nationalists, but people generally have a strong affiliation with their homeland. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. When you are insulting people, you don't really get your message across. It was not a critique, but rather provocative act.

Toyota/Staples center might not let you pass them out on arena property, and you have to have volunteers or employees handing them out somewhere where people can actually get them. And then you have to get a significant number of actual fans (who have probably barely been paying attention to the controversy) to wear the things. Ideally you'd get enough people to wear them that the TV cameras have no choice but to show them.

Since Morey publicly criticized them for an issue that the United States already agreed not to do, it seems China may be responding in a manner consistent with any one breaking that agreement/concession to remain quiet on HK.

ignorant drones that love to hate on China due to jealousy? Only
the elites support Chinese govt?  Not if you go and ask any Chinese student here in the US or other countries.  They are happy to be in a well off economic situation thanks to Chinas miracle growth which allows them an opportunity to allow them to matriculate overseas.

3377,NotanRedditor,t2_gn1th,"Tillman might be a sleeze in a lot of his business ventures, but as far as the Rockets, at least roster wise, he hasnt hurt the team at all by being cheap. He has paid Capela and Paaaiidd E-Gordon. Maybe you can hold it against him for not going over the cap for Iggy, but I wouldnt. I guess there was the case of him using emails the rockets acquired to push his book/ other ventures, but that seems like kinda of a minor thing. He has also been really good with reviving the UH basketball program so I think Houston's sports is something he actually cares about 

As far as Tillmans statement about Morey. Did Tillman really say anything diffrent from Silvers 2nd statement? Other than maybe Tillman didnt use as much lawyer terms, both statements are pretty much summed up as ""Morey has his personal opions, and dosnt reflect the NBA/Rockets .

3512,shadyassrussian,t2_305n03r7,"Yes, I agree that understanding the distinction between cultural and governmental authoritarianism is important in this mess. However, how fair is it really to say that it is their culture that propels their government, and not the other way around? In the end, it is their government that is armed and choses what they can or cannot see, and what they are allowed to speak on. 

A key factor in authoritarian societies, including the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, are using pre-existing cultural structures to form a nationalistic attitude to excuse their own censorship and mass murder of the people in their borders. These extreme actions in turn end up benefitting those who turn a blind eye and attach themselves to the system the most.  In that regard, I think you are giving China's authoritarian aspects too much credit for what is realistically an un-original reboot taking place in the 21st century.

In any case, excusing attrocities commited on defenseless innocents stuck within a country in the modern day is reprehensible. It's not worth considering the cultural roots are entertwined with a society like that, because those roots were always meant to be a means to an end, and are most likely hollow already.",1570506459,f2z4rsm,t1_f2z2pzb,/r/rockets/comments/dena9t/translation_top_upvoted_response_to_nbas/f2z4rsm/,1,rockets,comment

I do not disagree with you but it’s not what you say but how you say it in communications. This is a long-term challenge. Who knows — something spontaneous like this could be the catalyst.

My issue is with CCP/CBA using its influence to stifle freedom of speech and silence criticism of US nationals outside of China. I feel like this is a major threat to freedom of speech here in the US. 

Sure it’s small and in this case it’s the NBA but who says this won’t happen in the future if you work at a major grocery store, car manufacturing plant, tech store or somewhere that might have international ties to socialist authoritarian governments like China who can use their market size to influence what people say. 

People will argue that Morey was not put in prison for saying what he said so freedom of speech wasn’t threatened. However, where is the acceptable line of the pressure that can be applied via avenues such as economic threats and the practical loss of freedom of speech of US nationals by foreign governments?",1570517838,f2zeqlk,t3_dew4p5,/r/rockets/comments/dew4p5/thunder_fan_from_mainland_china_come_in_peace/f2zeqlk/,1,rockets,comment

Take away the horrible start by the team and looking at what he was after coming back from injury, he was every bit as good in Houston as he was in Philly.

&gt;but that being said yeah we could have used him. And Temple is a net negative player, no way i trust that he’s the savior of this team. Jamychal Green would have been nice but dude ain’t pushing the needle. I think we just disagree where we were last season.

Obviously Green is the player I'm referencing as being helpful. Look at what Shumpert, Green, and House did in their time on the court...

40 points 19 boards 1 assist 3 steals 1 block 6 turnovers in 161 minutes.

Essentially 6.7p / 3.2r / 0.2a / .5s / 0.2b / 1to per game (27 minutes per game)

That is pathetic.

If you’re so smart, maybe you would be in a position of influence to actually change things rather than virtue signal.

Because as bad as it looks for Americans to talk about China's business, it is almost equally bad for mainland Chinese to talk about Hong Kong's desires.

For many generations, the city experienced freedoms and a way of life that separate it from the rest of China.

If they desire a protection of those freedoms, that should be assured to them... as it was part of the preconditions for the turnover of the city back to the Chinese government... a government that is very different from the one it was originally separated from.

C)It can't be both the owner's job to make sure they put a competitive product on the floor and tanking, aka the opposite of being competitive, is a good job. 
D) Also if you're gonna list teams that are ""bad now and in the future"", you can't leave off half the teams that tanked last year, it's not a one year process. How can you say the suns are in a good position for the future?
E)Whether it's because of incompetence or not is irrelevant to the fact that you think the commissioner can kick an owner out of the league for not at least making an earnest attempt to put together a good competitive team. Teams go decades with out even sniffing the playoffs, and you think Silver would kick out Tilman when the team has so far at least been a title contender 100% of his time as owner.

4326,malacorn,t2_1m8rqtop,"Houston Rockets star James Harden has offered an apology as the controversy over general manager Daryl Morey's tweet of support for Hong Kong protesters continued to grow at a crucial time for the NBA in China.

Harden was contrite as he spoke standing with teammate Russell Westbrook at a practice in Tokyo on Monday, three days after Morey posted a now-deleted tweet that read: ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.""

""We apologize. You know, we love China, we love playing there,"" Harden said. ""For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.""

The shot improvement will stop teams just sagging off him and daring him to shoot, which in turn will allow him to get better looks at the rim + easier to create opportunities for the rest of the team.

4743,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"Yeah I agree with fans being able to express their feels — and there is nothing wrong with Morey expressing his feelings as well but he absentmindedly did not vet this with the Rockets public relations department. That was a huge mistake if this is your point. There is another post about the positive side (branding) but it’s not super serious. It’s just trying to find bright spots in a dark situation. That’s all.  My guy that is close to the Rockets and in Asia right now is saying this thing could actually get worst (my understanding was it **may** get better). There will need to be something direct to address from Morey himself. 

One thing that should be highlighted is for years Morey has been very engaging with his fans and vocal on Social Media. He’s one of the smartest minds in basketball and globally respected as you know. Even though he advised for Danny Ainge — Ainge views Morey, the “Slippery Eel”, as a godsend to the games. 

His hyperactivity on social media and engagement with fans ultimately led to this mishap unfortunately and this is why other GMs and Coaches (not Kerr) avoid social media entirely for fear of something like this happening. It it unfortunate bc I have been able to have direct interaction with one of my fav GMs — Bobby on the Raptors being another as a childhood acquaintance of mine.  And now — we will see what unfolds. Terrible situation, that I am acknowledging but you control what you can going forward (not an Asian mentality for saving face and permanent consequences for those unfortunate or fortunate — i.e., lucky).

Edit: there is also danger to this for Americans as a clash in how things are done — a slippery slope. If Morey is fired, there will still be anger but just from another group — the larger NBA market currently and it’s constituents.

4900,NotanRedditor,t2_gn1th,"I think in the business world employees have been fired for less, but Morey does have a lot of job security being being in a high position in the organization (and a really hard position to replace at that). 

That said this whole situation has morphed beyond an employees tweets and kinda into the realm of Chinese vs Western views.

I can see Tillman losing some support in America if he bends over too much trying to reopen the chinese market. If Tillman fires Morey he would lose some support from his American market. With China really effectively closing its Market to the Rockets I guess Tillman has a couple of choices. Wait out the Chinese, bend over backwards for them to open up their markets again, or maybe just take a PR win in America and publicly support HK.

Personally I dont know what Tillman will do. Fire Morey would lose home support, but firing Morey would probably open the Chinese market to the Rockets the fastest. Like I said this thing has morphed from a tweet to really a China vs Western Ideals area of debate and whatever Tillman does is really going to be telling of what the ""Fertitta era"" of the Rockets organization is all about.",1570380413,f2s8sv7,t3_de5ftz,/r/rockets/comments/de5ftz/daryl_morey/f2s8sv7/,7,rockets,comment

And I seriously doubt Morey gets fired. If he were a mediocre GM, it's easy for guys to lose their jobs over stuff like this. But Morey is arguably the best GM in the NBA (definitely in the top 3) and Tilman is the new owner that already is kind of finding it hard to gain the respect from Rockets fans. If he fires Morey over this, Tilman would face a HUGE backlash from the fans. 

And it has nothing to do with Tilman ""quieting"" the man who stood his ground and said something about what is going on in China.

4970,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"I'm not sure what you mean by losing capital. Do you mean that figuratively or are you saying he might get fined? 

I could see the NBA maybe fining him some customary amount just to make it look like they are distancing themselves from him (although I don't think there is precedent for fines for stuff like this, but I suppose there always is a first).

I don't see Tilman fining him. Or at the very least, I would be worried for the future of the team if he did. 

One of the things I worry about is not Morey getting fired, but that he would leave Houston at some point. And 3 years ago I would've said Morey would never leave Houston because of the respect the city has for him and all of the work he's done. But there is a real chance he could if he just really doesn't get along with Tilman and in about 5 or so years there is the potential that Houston will be moving towards being a rebuilding team, right about the time Morey's contract is expiring. There would be a window where it would make sense to leave.

And I would think Tilman realizes that Morey is fucking good at his job (it's possible he doesn't but Tilman comes off as someone who has followed the Rockets closely for the past 20 years) and that if Morey leaves in 5 years (probably dragging some of the better front office talent with him to his new team), Tilman would undoubtedly be the top reason why... and Rockets fans would revolt against him because he pushed Morey away. 

And Morey is still not even 50 years old yet. He has a good 20 years where he'll probably be a top GM in the league. And if that winds up being for another team other than Houston, that's a disaster situation.",1570382462,f2sflxm,t1_f2sdf9x,/r/rockets/comments/de5ftz/daryl_morey/f2sflxm/,3,rockets,comment

It is similar to the Kaepernick situation but he has a whole mess of overly passionate folk from another very profitable market that will be taking aim at him without the support from that market to cancel it out. Tillman is just putting necessary distance between the tweet and the organization. Any reasonable business person would either have done it or have someone else do it.

5189,hallowilliam,t2_l6mnm,"I know your point, I'm not trying to defend china on internet control and human right, etc. But the problem here is information barrier exists on both side, At least I took my time to do the research in order to have a better understanding of the event itself. I also visited HK last month to actually see it in my own eyes. 

I live in the US now. but I go to China for at least 3 months per year.  I believe I know china more than 99% of people in r/rockets. HK situation might start with good reasons, very good reasons indeed, for western mainstream media. But the fact is, in has involved to a stage that most protesters left now do not hold the same opinion with whoever starts it. 

its okay to downvote me because all things seem unrelated to the rockets org, I understand people are mad at Chinese fans. But as i said, it should have been better if Morey didnt say it in public. If he didn't delete his tweet, I probably would respect his freedom to speech better. Now it seems like the rockets org and morey himself all agree this is a bad choice.

to give a small example, I don't think you ever will see footage like this in western mainstream media. As there exist people who start the act with good reason, now most Chinese AND Hong Kong citizens feel it is over the limit.

This is what’s happening right now. An unedited raw video taken by a rioter. 
Students in HK have been in rage mode for months. They carried metal pipes, hammer (heard the metal sound at beginning?) etc, and seeked out police officers and found one. A dozen of guys chased and knocked down the officer and started beating him while he’s on the ground with whatever they were carrying.
A handful of other officers came to his rescue. One of them pointed the gun at rioters and asked them to stop, then one of the rioters charged towards the officer and swung his weapon at the officer and the gun went off, I think hitting the rioter’s arm. (Better shown in an alternative angle in an CNN video, but they crop out anything doesn’t serve their agenda and call it news.)

Tell me what officers in Texas would do when 5-10 guys went at 1 officer like that? 

Police officers in HK did hurt some civilians, but most of the time it’s the civilians who kept pushing them to the edge.

I’m not trying to go political here, I think HK ppl should have the right to their freedom, but I don’t think burning banks, subway stations etc, is the way. I don’t think violence is the answer.",1570287809,f2kol1y,t1_f2keuih,/r/rockets/comments/ddjf3a/macmahon_tilman_fertitta_to_espn_i_have_the_best/f2kol1y/,1,rockets,comment

5979,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,Yes -- Lowe is the only one that really gives insightful takes for me at ESPN. We'll see how the new crop pans out.  But Lowe's take on the Rockets has been lukewarm at best.  Even the Jazz's addition of the Bogdanovic is not significant enough.  Maybe I'm overrating our wing situation or he could be underrating it or maybe it's somewhere in the middle but I feel that we've gotten much better outside of the CP3-Russ silo trade.  We will see.  Last night was hard to tell where the role players for the Clippers were in relevance to ours since Clint and Harden were doing their thing which skews any comparison and the coaches were strategized differently (Doc not likely driven to win -- I don't think MDA was either but Harden loves to hoop!).,1570210023,f2f3uz8,t1_f2f2xl2,/r/rockets/comments/dda729/zach_lowe_on_the_rockets_everyone_wonders_if/f2f3uz8/,1,rockets,comment

6000,Beleedatljera8,t2_2w4pvy9c,"Bro you sound like a no nothing fan boy. Harden is a phenomenal player the best scorer of his generation and on pace to be the best combination of volume and efficient scoring ever. I am not taking anything away from him. If you can’t look at Giannis and see that he has that his physical tools are the best in NBA history then I’m sorry, you are a idiot. He is a super mobile 7 footer that, while raw as hell, is going to give him certain advantages that players like harden can never have. James harden is more skilled of course. His step back is money but it is still ,league wide, a inefficient shot and if it drops by a few percentage points for any reason it’s value is neutered. The value of a Giannis drive to the rim will always have a floor that will be similar to a harden iso but Giannis will be bigger/faster/stronger until he’s 33 years old. That’s the caliber of athlete he is. Harden is not that caliber of athlete and in the NBA physicals matter. The point being that harden already scores with a degree of difficulty that (while he is very good at doing) will never be the case for Giannis. Giannis will be have the advantage on any player in front of him for every possession for the rest of his career. Can James bridge the gap in skill? Maybe that remains to be seen but the degree of difficulty in closing that gap in athleticism is going to be harder than it would be for Giannis to close the gap in skill. As for harden not exploiting the rules that’s laughable. No one who is a close follower of the game agrees with you: not executives, not analysts, not statisticians, not players, not coaches, and not NBA fans. That’s no knock on him he has a great strategy in a game that’s built on strategy.  And btw the east projects as the weaker conference for the next 5 years.

As for harden not exploiting the rules that’s laughable. No one who is a close follower of the game agrees with you: not executives, not analysts, not statisticians, not players, not coaches, and not NBA fans. That’s no knock on him he has a great strategy in a game that’s built on strategy.  And btw the east projects as the weaker conference for the next 5 years. 
TL;DR you can’t teach athleticism but you can teach , at least to some degree, a step back.",1570074795,f28z2x3,t1_f28x5qm,/r/rockets/comments/dcebld/why_cant_people_on_here_just_appreciate_giannis/f28z2x3/,1,rockets,comment

6110,FarWestEros,t2_b40e0aj,"I'd sort of keep Eric's minutes with Russ (for the shooting), bringing the two of them out around the 6 or 7 minute mark for House and Rivers (playing with Harden, PJ, and Capela). Then they can come back either at the tail end of the first or beginning of the second depending upon how long Harden wants to play.

Thabo (good chemistry with Russ) comes in for PJ a bit later... probably around the time Harden sits, too. 

Obviously Chandler will not play every game, but when we have matchups where we need his big body/defense, he'll likely be in for Clint a little earlier than when PJ and Harden come out (8-9 min mark?) Ideally, Hartenstein will be able to step up and play some center when Russ is running solo (Ryno or even Clark would also work as a small-ball option) because then we can just play everyone out beyond the arc.",1570114841,f2allhr,t3_dcqsm9,/r/rockets/comments/dcqsm9/what_players_are_you_wanting_to_see_run_with/f2allhr/,1,rockets,comment

6134,shakeemshake,t2_3qty54d0,"Appreciate the advice but ima just chill, b/c the organization doesnt care either lol. Youre right tho, someone might have a cable level above mine that has NBA TV. I actually used to have it but never needed it so I downgraded lol. But thats too much work real talk, and I dont like asking people for that personal type of shit. Plus I would have access to their whole internet/home security/tv/phone provider account(xfinity does all of em at least) that has financial info too, you know what I mean? All I know is I would never give my login info to anybody except my brother, which I've done already, so I wouldn't expect the same for me.

My thing is I pay for xfinity so I feel like this is a AT&amp;T Sportsnet and/or Rox leadership being cheap issue more than anything else. Or maybe I'm missing out on something in regards to some expert level CBA contract TV rights/negotiations shit, that the fans aren't privy to. Maybe thats why the Rox wont send Craig(Im assuming Bill aint tryna to go overseas lmao) and Bull over to Hawaii and Japan.

The clippers are sending Fox sports West out there(thats how NBA TV is broadcasting it) and the raps are sending their [SportsNet/SNE crew to Japan](https://www.nba.com/games/20191008/HOUTOR#/matchup). Theres [even proof on the toronto Sportnet website with the SN logo right there](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/scores/2019-10-08).  

Like I said the rox will give us a FB link tonight, so they're technically accommodating us. But the part that annoys me is a. The past 3 years the FB link info isn't easily available and they don't even drop the link till like an hour at best before the game and b. the links have been hella shitty. So it's not a comparable product at all for what I pay for, which is HD 1080p minimum with the ability to DVR it so I dont have to wake up at 5am lol. Its ridiculous that Id have to pay for, pirate, or ask somebody for a NBA TV login just to have access to 3 preseason games(one of which Russ is debuting). I wont need NBA TV the rest of the year at all 100%. Thats wild to me.

Yes its the preseason and Im bitching like a mf rn, so who cares, but as a consumer I'm not getting the same value as a clippers or raptors fan for the next 3 games. On top of that, I cant even DVR the damn game lmao, so you have to watch it live, on a shitty FB link, that wont drop till 11:30pm CT today or until like 4amCT for next week. Yall feel me or am I tripping? Too much fan bitching perhaps? Isnt that what Im supposed to do, be a crazy wild fan that wants to watch games?

He shows flashes but needs to be consistent.  Part of it is BBIQ.  He needs to do whatever if asked of him there and study film on his own and show self-direction to be great.

6185,sohummm,t2_7bxrs,"So much to unpack here!

1) Ever heard of paragraphs?

&gt; Harden is a phenomenal player the best scorer of his generation and on pace to be the best combination of volume and efficient scoring ever.

2) This alone is a reason why he is ahead of Giannis. He has already proven that he is a generational talent with actual performances. Giannis has proven it in **1 season**.

&gt; If you can’t look at Giannis and see that he has that his physical tools are the best in NBA history then I’m sorry, you are a idiot.

3) Wait, you really think Giannis' physical tools are the ""best in **NBA history**""? Wow. And you call me a ""no"" nothing (it's supposed to be know, btw) fanboy. Lmao.

&gt; He is a super mobile 7 footer that, while raw as hell, is going to give him certain advantages that players like harden can never have.

4) Uh, yeah, height. NBA is still a game of skill, not raw athleticism. Which is why Giannis got shut down several times in the playoffs by players who were less athletic than him. He will need to develop that skill to actually maximize his physical gifts. And it's not a given that he's going to do that.

&gt; His step back is money but it is still ,league wide, a inefficient shot and if it drops by a few percentage points for any reason it’s value is neutered.

5) How does it matter if it is a league-wide inefficient shot if it is efficient for him? Do you also think Curry's 3 point shot is not as valuable as Giannis' athleticism because it is a leaguewide more inefficient shot than a dunk and thus if it drops by a few percentage points, it's value is neutered?

&gt; The value of a Giannis drive to the rim will always have a floor that will be similar to a harden iso but Giannis will be bigger/faster/stronger until he’s 33 years old.

6) The blueprint to stop Giannis is already out there. Just stop him from driving and make him shoot. Until he has a working shot (i.e. skill), his ability to get to the rim will become harder and harder.

&gt; Can James bridge the gap with skill?

7) He already has.

&gt; Maybe that remains to be seen but the degree of difficulty in closing that gap in athleticism is going to be harder than it would be for Giannis to close the gap in skill.

8) This is such a bullshit assumption. You're literally saying that the decades of hard work that Harden has put in to become one of the best offensive players of his generation will be bridged by Giannis within the next 9 years (of his so-called prime)?

&gt; As for harden not exploiting the rules that’s laughable.

9) You said he ""relied on exploitation of rules"". That is what is laughable. Harden would be unguardable even if the rules were tweaked to allow defenders to take up his landing space and to hand-check and reach. Similarly, Giannis' ability to get to the rim would also be affected if refs actually called his off-arm push an offensive foul.

&gt; And btw the east projects as the weaker conference for the next 5 years.

10) The West has always been the tougher conference and despite this Giannis still has 0 Finals appearances. I don't see them getting past Philly this year and if KD comes back at even 75% of his previous strength, they're going to get dispatched by the Nets.

&gt; TL;DR you can’t teach athleticism but you can teach , at least to some degree, a step back.

11) Maybe Giannis should learn how to shoot normal pull up shots at efficiency before attempting something that is clearly out of his skill range right now.

---

My argument, which you completely ignore, is that Harden has already put together half a decade worth of great, MVP-worthy seasons. Giannis has 1. Harden's first MVP worthy season was at age 25 and Giannis' was at age 24. So it's not like Giannis is miles ahead of Harden in terms of potential.

To just assume Giannis will keep improving at the rate that Harden improved is insulting to Harden. Literally every year analysts think that Harden has been figured out or relies on something that cannot be repeated and every year he comes back with an even better season than the last.

If Giannis can have another dominant, MVP-worthy season we can talk again. But until then, Harden is clearly ahead because he actually has the results on the board.",1570125815,f2bfoo2,t1_f28z2x3,/r/rockets/comments/dcebld/why_cant_people_on_here_just_appreciate_giannis/f2bfoo2/,1,rockets,comment

So, he's had some tough playoff moments.

6586,followdamntrainCJ,t2_wqcwbnd,"Giannis improved a whopping 0.8 points. 2.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists. Difference between him last year and this year was the rest of his team and coach bud

Meanwhile Harden was playing with a crippled rockets team, averaged 40 for half the season and went from his average to the highest we've seen in decades. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is MVP a team award or a individual award?

There just needs to be a more defined answer to what makes an MVP. Making History? Being best player on the best team? But would anyone on the warriors would have won MVP last year with their stacked roster if they finished first? People even said having KD and Curry on the same team lessens their chances at winning MVP.

6632,slyguy183,t2_3296x,Well teams were already afraid of the Rockets last year as the Rockets were really the only team GSW respected and wanted to beat out of the West.  Westbrook really does give us a different dimension of attacking the rim in transition that we really didn't have outside of Harden going coast to coast or Capela's rim running. But Harden did not have the energy to do that every possession and CP3 did not have the footspeed to be outrunning guys.

6658,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,**There’s no hate for Giannis**. It is just a combination of the love for the Beard combined with the lived-through appreciation of what he did game-by-game at a micro-level versus what the media was saying is going on at the macro-level (to be fair I didn’t watch much Bucks’ games).   The criteria used as the primary driver was wins in which ironically the Russ vs. Harden for MVP year comes to mind where the framework used seemed to have flipped and presumably for narrative. Regardless they were both great and as a Harden/Rockets fan it is unfortunate bc Harden has less years ahead (maybe) than Giannis who will have tons of “opportunities” (hopefully) so that’s where there is a small pain point. Harden was insane last year and so was Giannis so there was never going to be a unanimous and certain closure on this.  Only time will tell on which season was more memorable.,1570041617,f27mnak,t3_dcebld,/r/rockets/comments/dcebld/why_cant_people_on_here_just_appreciate_giannis/f27mnak/,1,rockets,comment

6663,Beleedatljera8,t2_2w4pvy9c,"Okay so from my perspective. James harden had the best offensive season in history and it’s not even particularly close. Giannis has greater 2 way impact but ultimately didn’t even have a top ten offensive season of the past decade. The MAIN problem hear is the elephant in the room. Giannis is going to go down (barring injury) as a top 10 player all time he’s just that good. He passes the eye test in a way that I’ve personally never seen from a prospect before. He is the perfect athletic specimen and is only scratching the surface. The point is that Giannis will have his time, and he will have a lot of it. Over the next decade he will compete for titles, win imo multiple MVPs, DPoYs etc. We witnessed something that was so far and away a outlier in a analytics sense that having Giannis as mvp seems premature seeing as we may look back on this season from him as a bottom 5 season of his career. To say James harden should’ve won mvp this year is not to say he’s better than Giannis just that he was better this year and it detracts from harden’s case to be a top 10 all time great when Giannis may as well be penciled in at this point.",1570042214,f27nlsr,t3_dcebld,/r/rockets/comments/dcebld/why_cant_people_on_here_just_appreciate_giannis/f27nlsr/,1,rockets,comment

6714,Gen50,t2_4iti8xxy,"&gt; He passes the eye test in a way that I’ve personally never seen

Dude I just don't get this perspective. I just watched the Top 10 plays from his career (posted a month ago) and the sequence was this:

10) Dunk

9) Block

8) Running dunk

7) Steal then dunk

6) Dunk over a guy

5) Dunk

4) Dunk

3) Spinning layup

2) Dunk

1) Stepback buzzer beater (from about 6 ft away)

...

I guess we're spoiled since Harden does this kind of stuff in his sleep while having 10ppg more each season.

Claiming that Harden has to rely on rule exploitation tells me all I need to know about your understanding of the game. And yeah, it's an inefficient shot for most anyone except Harden. That's what makes it great.

Seriously your argument is like saying Steph Curry relied on a deep three during his unanimous MVP year which was an inefficient shot. Yeah no shit, because he's really fucking good at it and better than anyone else.

7015,SeaynO,t2_qbr9ihi,"You're being purposefully obtuse if you can't see how saying that he can't wait to go into the post season with a real killer after going into the post season with CP3 the past two years is straight up saying that Chris isn't a real killer despite averaging 21/6/6 his first year in the playoffs with the Rockets and 17/6/5.5 the next with two steals to go along with it each year. 

The dog part is talking about determination, which means he think Chris didn't really try hard enough and the killer part obviously is saying that he doesn't think Chris is about to dominate games, which is pretty ridiculous with some of the statlines he has put up. 

You're just stupid, if you can't see that CP3 is acting professionally while there has been a lot of shade thrown his way. I don't know about before the trade but there is no doubt any longer that Harden helped facilitate the trade for Russ, so he definitely is the reason CP3 is gone, so saying otherwise is ridiculous. I never said he was forcing him out before the trade because I thought everything was overblown but every comment about obtaining Russ has either been ill worded OR they're intentionally wording them in an effort to put blame on Chris. 

Stop trying to put a twist to the insults that Harden and Tilman have aimed at Chris. Everybody has faults but that doesn't mean they need to shunt blame for the last two seasons to Paul.

7138,Strangeclouds420,t2_cx685,You’re leaving out his injury history which really hurt the rockets. He had it all cerebrally but he couldn’t stay on the court and a lot of times could not beat his man in the iso-heavy offense. At the signing of the contract I believed it was either too long and/or too expensive annually. They shouldn’t have given him the max on all fronts.,1569942734,f241g59,t1_f22zx3v,/r/rockets/comments/dbj20l/chris_paul_was_asked_about_houston_its_tough_i/f241g59/,1,rockets,comment

7143,WuziMuzik,t2_4b1rptk,"he doesn't deserve a minimum, he got a contract he deserves. him taking a minimum would be a cap favor. his contract was a hard to move contract just like westbrook's is. it's not just how good the player is or isn't perceived as, the contract itself does matter in that regard. even a contract like harden's is a hard to move contract, a team would have to gut itself to make a trade like that. and cp3 couldn't take a short changed contract because he was in the midst of making a point for the players, because stars taking less then they are worth was being an issue and the PA have beeb fighting against it being necessary. i don't know if he personally would have taken a smaller deal if they could have still got russ and there was no pressure from the public or PA. but he did get a contract he deserved, but it came with other repercussions. and his heart and dedication has not been questioned by anyone in houston, and i haven't heard that in the media either. his age and body breaking down have been the only real concerns about cp3 and then people in the media overblown his demeanor in a negative way. everyone involved still seems to maintain that has nothing to do with it. harden reportedly wanted russ on his team for years before cp3 even got there, so that didn't have anything to do with it either considering he also wanted cp3 there too. i really believe if the cap was unlimited and they could make moves while paying everyone they would absolutely love to have cp3 still on the rockets. they would have probably had to trade eric gordon+ if that were the case though. just to get the russ trade approved.",1569943361,f242ekh,t1_f22zx3v,/r/rockets/comments/dbj20l/chris_paul_was_asked_about_houston_its_tough_i/f242ekh/,1,rockets,comment

Chris Paul is historically impactful. It sucked for Houston when he got injured and I can understand trading him. The only thing I think is a poor reflection in the Rockets are these comments that are almost certainly worded to throw shade at him. He's a good player and he's been good to the community.

My biggest issue is the comment Harden made about going to the playoffs with, roughly condensed, a determined and good player. And the owner talking about how Russ and Harden will act like brothers instead of one player acting like a mentor. The subtle and not-so-subtle shade being thrown into the public arena is just kind of crappy, especially when it's all aimed at Chris currently.

7255,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"You’re right.  That’s a big if for both Ryno and Hartenstein.  There’s literally nothing else for Hartenstein to prove in the G-League besides shore up BBIQ but he will never make the leap if he stays with inferior competition.  He won G-League Finals MVP and put up absurd numbers on both ends of the floor while consistently knocking down 3-pointers.  Him making a leap would depend on opportunities such as last year when we were super limited that he had to guard KD in an early regular season game and showed glimpses of how valuable he could be by being defensively attuned to the switching scheme and giving KD some resistance on the perimeter.  However, he fell out of the rotation and spent way too much time away to be effective when he was asked to come back at the end of the G-League season.  This season is now or never for him on the Rockets and he would probably do better on another team with opportunities rather than a contender if he doesn’t immediately contribute. 

Ryno is a feel-good gamble.  You’d love to see him turn back the clock but he didn’t look great after falling out of the starting line-up with the Suns early last season and then completely out of rotation with the Heat that just didn’t have a need for him.",1569962843,f24yzlw,t1_f24xk0r,/r/rockets/comments/dbwyfs/postsigning_anderson_which_position_needs_the/f24yzlw/,1,rockets,comment

AR, GG, TS, DH, TC 

GC, IH, NH

Those are the guys that have a decent chunk of guaranteed money coming their way, so I suspect they make the roster.

Ryno also has a 250k guarantee, giving him an inside track to a spot (only a great tc from Bennett kicks him out, imo).

That leaves only one spot left.

One of Bennett, McLemore, Frazier, Ponds, Blossingame, Clemons makes it, 2 get 2-ways and 3 go to RGV.

So realistically (by fit/experience), I guess McLemore will get the spot if he shows he can do it.

I'm rooting for Clemons and Bennett to make our 2-way contracts, but mainly cause I know nothing valuable about anyone else.",1569847598,f1zptrg,t3_db5h0h,/r/rockets/comments/db5h0h/final_roster_predictions/f1zptrg/,1,rockets,comment

8000,boxonfire,t2_5iqyb,"Interesting points:

- He wants to bounce back from last year, went from vet team to all young team that didn't have an identity, he's glad to be back with a team that has 1 goal and he's familiar with that

- ""This is a group that... I mean what do we lack? That's what it felt like a few years ago. This year there's excitement in the air.""

- Says his job and a lot of other guys job is to space the floor and let harden and russ do their thing (not a fan of this...)

- Tyson adds more than what you see on and off the court, he's a great leader and veteran. Has a knack for offensive rebounding with tapbacks

- Says his journey has been one of many mental struggles, ups and downs, if you know my story you know theres been challenges. last year was a challenge he's never experienced before, but he doesn't wanna complain, says hes learned from it and feels fortunate to be where he is to have a chance to play for houston again.

- Conversations about re-joining began happening months ago(!) with dantoni, and then heated up with morey recently

- In response to a question about not having that huge contract anymore, says its tough being a guy making a lot of money and not playing and getting a lot of minutes, says it was a frustration and definitely a big ego trip, and it got talked alot by the media. Says now, pressures off, and he can enjoy the game again and be a great teammate and the player they want him to be.

He also shot 38% from 3 when catch and shoot as opposed to pull ups 31%.

Russ also starts slow when shooting, usually facilitates a lot early on, then gets his rhythm late in games.

In 4th quarters last year (after the ASB, he started hurt) the man shot 47 from the field and 36 from 3. 42% catch and shoot, 47% when open.

8114,spicy62,t2_1khn6z45,"Not saying youre wrong but this is the thing lets look at russ's 2017 MVP first. First off it really has never been done he came off a season where KD a top 5 player left for nothing (no sign and trade, nothing) and they still got 47 wins and the 6th seed all because of him. And he did average a 32-10-10 triple double which nobody has ever done. I dont like comparing it to Oscars because the compeition was much much worse back then, less teams, on top of that russ did it with little to no shooting around to him etc... It was something unprecendented people do things with scoring, defense, etc... but I just thought russ revolutionized it with that season. You also have to look at the narrative added, KD leaves then people feel bad for russ so it adds on to him winning the MVP (not saying thats the reason but it adds to it)

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets compare it to James in 2019 yes the scoring is scoring but he did it at an astronomical rate, he carried/willed/whatever he was that spectacular and to this day I still dont know why he didnt win the MVP as it was more deserved over what giannis did. James had a better record compared to Kobes 2005-2006 season, more ppg, more apg, more rpg and yes I do believe Kobe deserved MVP that year also but again its like this people vote for narratives a long with somebody doing the unseen. People get used to scoring so they factor in ""oh what happens if he averages a triple double now""? Nash's mvp was similar to giannis in 2019 where the team had 52+ wins a likeable non polarizing superstar  and with Amare the whole season it was very impressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Well look at the tripld double like this russ has averaged it for the past 2 seasons as well but this past season for instance he was all nba third team instead of second for instance why is that? Its because people get used to stuff like this. On top of that James had just won his MVP in 2018 so the voters may have felt a swing in ""oh this likeable superstar giannis led the bucks to 60 wins, plays all world defense and isnt a polarizing player to watch unlike James so lets give it to him"". Thats how voters view things and I dont like seeing it like that. MVP means Most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically. I defeintly see that more with James in 2015 as opposed to steph. I see that greatly with russ in 2017. I see that greatly with James in 2019 as well.",1569770137,f1vf4ju,t1_f1qpson,/r/rockets/comments/da82n7/russ_on_the_media_saying_him_and_harden_cant_play/f1vf4ju/,2,rockets,comment

8126,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"&gt;Thats how voters view things and I dont like seeing it like that.

Yeah, but again voters have consistantly voted guys like Giannas (top team in conference but lesser stats) over guys like Harden pretty consistently in the history of the NBA. It would be one thing if the consensus historically was to vote for the Westbrook-esque seasons of great stats but no team success, but it's been the opposite. 

&gt;MVP means Most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically. 

Again, if you look at how people have voted on the award historically, a just as valid argument would be that the MVP is best player on one of the best teams. I think the reason why people have that opinion is because there is this notion that yeah you can have a season like Westbrook did, but then we all knew that they didn't realistically have a shot at winning a title. So how valuable can you be in a ""can you bring your team a championship"" sense if you are almost certainly getting knocked out in the first round.

I'm not saying that your opinion is wrong by any means. It's all just opinions. And personally, I would be fine with them more strictly defining the criteria and/or creating a 2nd award that is more centered on just crazy regular season numbers. But the NBA (probably intentionally) has made the criteria for the award vague because every year people like to argue what they think the MVP means and it drives discussion in the NBA.",1569773837,f1voohr,t1_f1vf4ju,/r/rockets/comments/da82n7/russ_on_the_media_saying_him_and_harden_cant_play/f1voohr/,1,rockets,comment

8186,spicy62,t2_1khn6z45,cp3 didnt even guard the opposing guards or best scorers on the opposing team in fact it was the third primary wing overall that he guarded.

We will have those anomaly years though in which something different is done (russ in 2017 and what should have been harden especially in 2019) for instance lets say if (random name) doncic averages 23/10/13 while shooting 50/40/90 and leads the mavs to the 7th seed whereas a guy like jokic averages 22/11 on 47/32/84 and leads the nuggets to the 2nd seed. Voters might feel more inclined to vote for Doncic here as nobody expects the mavs to be in the playoffs tbh let alone the 7th seed on top of that he averages a triple double and goes for a 50/40/90 thats just what i mean by anomaly years.",1569796775,f1xd4nt,t1_f1voohr,/r/rockets/comments/da82n7/russ_on_the_media_saying_him_and_harden_cant_play/f1xd4nt/,1,rockets,comment

And on the offensive end it's going to be even better because if Harden gets switched onto a PF or C defensively. Then they get a stop and suddenly Harden has a bad matchup on him from the start in transition. It's going to lead to easy scoring opportunities on the other end.

Even more so now that we're going to be running more, it will make it far easier to take advantage of those mismatches that were initially created by letting Harden get switched onto a big.",1569802215,f1xq1wu,t3_db18i9,/r/rockets/comments/db18i9/less_switching_possibility/f1xq1wu/,2,rockets,comment

I think hartenstein is the only one that’s a question mark here. I’m the last person to ask about contracts and roster availability and all those rules. But I think due to contracts and free agents signings all these young guys are gonna be cut or in the g league I’m not to sure how that works. My hopefuls are Clemons 100% and I’m kinda rooting for Anthony Bennett. But our is looking very good cause there’s not one guy I don’t wanna see on the court but unfortunately the rotation can only be so big.

I forgot you even existed in that time, sad stuff really. 

It’s also funny cuz if you were an actual rockets fan and not a bucks fan you would know that he most likely isn’t 6’5.  He is 6’5 in shoes on a good day, but he again, is around 6’3 / 6’4. You can’t make an informed judgment due to the camera angle and I think you count hair here cuz you gettin desperate lmao. You were the one so triggered that you lost an argument to me that you came back with an even weaker argument (if you weren’t copying mine) and you have the audacity to call ME slow?

8699,Danbobway,t2_2svgie,"It’s not about changing what you think, the first thing you said was “you don’t know why people here didn’t like Westbrook” I gave you the reason, this is a Houston sub where Harden has been robbed multiple years in a row one of which was one that Westbrook got, I’m not saying it’s law I’m answering your question that’s why people here didn’t like Westbrook.

Imagine if Harden won it last year, you wouldn’t go to their sub and and wonder why they don’t like Harden cause they would think Giannis should have won it, it’s that simple.

And again don’t take this as hate or me saying that it wasn’t close because i would have for sure supported Westbrook if I was an OKC fan. This has been Hardens team and he’s been competing against Westbrook for years of course they will be compared and some people are going to think one is better than the other.

And the NBA hate train is consistent because the other duo that haters have constantly questioned is the Ben Simmons/Embiid duo, and it's the same idea.

8712,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"It seems like based on your hypothetical picks for MVP those years, you tend to like voting for the guy that is on a ""less successful"" team but maybe had to face adversity. 

Thing is, if you look at historically how people have voted for the award. They time and time again have voted for the candidate on the better team (even if they didn't have the best scoring season) over the guy with just the raw numbers. Oscar Robertson didn't win MVP when he averaged a triple double. Wilt didn't win it when he averaged 50 and 20 either. Kobe didn't win it when he averaged 35, he actually came in 4th in voting.

And the numbers for bad teams with MVPs on them were very low. It was like less than 3 times in the 60+ year history of the MVP award did it go to a team lower than the 3 seed in their conference.

That's why I was so against a Westbrook MVP. I would've been more of a fan if they consistently voted that way every year. Or if at the very least voted that way more than 3 times in the history of the NBA. But basically just the one time, and the two other times when voting that way would've benefited the Rockets, obviously they went back to their traditional ""voting for the best player on one of the best teams"" criteria.",1569704679,f1qpson,t1_f1pldif,/r/rockets/comments/da82n7/russ_on_the_media_saying_him_and_harden_cant_play/f1qpson/,1,rockets,comment

8717,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"Robert Covington was an undrafted guy when we had him (similar to say Gary Clark). We wound up just straight up cutting him IIRC because he was like the 12th or 13th best player on the team and we needed to make room for him for some reason. 

You can't really fault Houston for not seeing he would become... a servicable starter in the NBA way back then. And it's arguable that he would've developed into that while on the Rockets. He got a good 2 years of 30+ minutes and no pressure to win in Philly.

Marcus Morris is slightly more of a confusing story. We traded him for a 2nd round pick to the Suns. That was also when we acquired Thomas Robinson from the Kings who was a similar situation of young player on a rookie deal at PF. I think there were two reasons why we moved on from him: 

1. We just had a glut of young PFs at the time. Remember, Terrance Jones was also someone we had recently drafted, and I think D'Mo was the same year as well. So if we felt like Marcus Morris wasn't getting the job done, might as well try to recoup his value by trading him for a 2nd rounder. 

2. Specifically why we would want Thomas Robinson as opposed to Marcus Morris. I remember people bringing up that Thomas Robinson's contract was much more tradable. I forget exactly why. It might've just been that it was under rookie control for 1 year longer. So if we needed to unload his contract for nothing (which we wound up doing and getting 2 2nds) we would be able to do that. And cap room wound up playing a big part because thats what led to us being able to sign Dwight Howard in free agency.",1569705908,f1qsmmv,t3_dalbn0,/r/rockets/comments/dalbn0/does_anyone_know_why_we_gave_up_on_roco_and/f1qsmmv/,1,rockets,comment

9114,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"* One of the only factual statements in the article: ""Players shoot about [four or five percentage points better](https://fansided.com/2016/02/23/introducing-free-throw-splits/) on the second free throw, and somewhere around six to nine percent better on the third shot compared to the first. This makes sense for obvious reasons: Taking a warmup shot or two makes a shot easier. By removing the second and third shot, players would live and die on that first, worse shot. That not only lowers the overall percentage, but consolidates the risk — one miss means no points. This would not only be good for the league, but necessary."" 
* Kyle refers to Harden as ""**annoying**"" and describes opposing minds to be ""**good guys**"":  ""The massive difference between the first and third shot would disproportionately affect some especially **annoying** players. James Harden, who uses the universally loathed stop-and-flail move to [draw more three-shot fouls than any NBA team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-gets-fouled-on-3s-more-than-any-nba-team/), would see the efficiency of those plays plummet. Enough to dissuade him from doing it? Perhaps not. But his reward for playing litigation ball would be lessened, which is a minor win for the **good guys**.""
* Anti-Harden sentiment from Kyle again in referring rule experiment as ""**welcome first step**"": ""That’s where we are today, and the reason Harden is completely in the right to play the way he does. It will take more drastic action than even this experimental rule to change that truth, but implementing it in the NBA would nonetheless be a **welcome first step**.""",1569600018,f1mqp47,t3_da2ejc,/r/rockets/comments/da2ejc/ny_daily_news_the_nba_just_began_its_war_on_james/f1mqp47/,1,rockets,comment

9259,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"""While the \[one-legged shot\] doesn’t appear likely to be a very high-percentage one in an actual NBA game, confidence accounts for a lot: The threat is arguably more valuable than the actual effectiveness of the shot. Like Curry’s half-court range, Harden is brandishing a weapon that he knows his defenders know he has—one that previously never had to be factored into a defense’s calculus. It’s just another element to Harden’s unplaceable, purposefully convoluted time signature. And it’s probably not the only one he’s ready to unveil.

9298,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"* One of the only factual statements in the article: ""Players shoot about [four or five percentage points better](https://fansided.com/2016/02/23/introducing-free-throw-splits/) on the second free throw, and somewhere around six to nine percent better on the third shot compared to the first. This makes sense for obvious reasons: Taking a warmup shot or two makes a shot easier. By removing the second and third shot, players would live and die on that first, worse shot. That not only lowers the overall percentage, but consolidates the risk — one miss means no points. This would not only be good for the league, but necessary.""
* Kyle refers to Harden as ""**annoying**"" and describes opposing minds to be ""**good guys**"":  ""The massive difference between the first and third shot would disproportionately affect some especially **annoying** players. James Harden, who uses the universally loathed stop-and-flail move to [draw more three-shot fouls than any NBA team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-gets-fouled-on-3s-more-than-any-nba-team/), would see the efficiency of those plays plummet. Enough to dissuade him from doing it? Perhaps not. But his reward for playing litigation ball would be lessened, which is a minor win for the **good guys**.""
* Anti-Harden sentiment from Kyle again in referring rule experiment as ""**welcome first step**"": ""That’s where we are today, and the reason Harden is completely in the right to play the way he does. It will take more drastic action than even this experimental rule to change that truth, but implementing it in the NBA would nonetheless be a **welcome first step**.""

9328,tylerw8999,t2_1ftog41,You can never have too many ball handlers. We lost that 2015 run (imo) because we didn’t have a 2nd ball handler. When Harden was out of the game or struggling we had Jason Terry as the PG.  Like if Morey built a team with Westbrook/Harden/ LeBron / Simmons / Jokic would people really say that 1 ball stuff?

9329,agentkirb,t2_hi65r,"Yeah, that's the one series where IMO you can say he choked. And he's had a few playoff series before then where he's been inefficient. But these last two post season runs he's been pretty good IMO.

I mean... if you really want to be critical you can look at that Utah Jazz series he was held to 28 points and 8 assists on less than 50% EFG. But at the same time, Utah obviously a top defensive team, and oh by the way the series was basically over after game 3 and most of the games were blowouts so it's kind of hard to really critique any result from that series. 

But again, look at the next series against Golden State, 35 a game hitting his normal efficiency. Perfectly fine series for him.",1569620272,f1nm01n,t1_f1n6tvz,/r/rockets/comments/d9vava/why_does_the_media_defend_giannis_so_much_for_his/f1nm01n/,1,rockets,comment

9559,FarWestEros,t2_b40e0aj,"538 comes up with some 'weird' stuff, but I find their projections are typically decent. Not sure how the Clippers are so low in their eyes, though. Normalizing their odds knocks some of the luster off the Rockets and Sixers. (to a lesser degree). I'd put our odds a little below 20%, realistically... Favorites in a Finals matchup but only about 40% at best to come out of the West, despite being the  team to beat.

Harden is tough to project, but I'm confident there won't be regression in his game. His numbers may take a hit depending on what kind of schemes we are going to run, but I'd guess 32/5.5/5.5 on his most efficient shooting in years... More than enough to secure his second MVP after we finish in the top seed in the West.",1569503006,f1hyedo,t3_d9inds,/r/rockets/comments/d9inds/rockets_20192020_predictions/f1hyedo/,1,rockets,comment

That same argument can be used to put Kobe ahead of LeBron; all the players that went against both of them seem to lean towards Kobe being the better player. Obviously, when looking at on court impact, that isn’t true at all. Honestly, peak Shaq was better than Olajuwon on offense. Olajuwon was probably the best defender of all time though. The way I see it, the two of them were on similar tiers, but I give the slight edge to Shaq because I value offense more. You can have extreme respect for a player and say they were better than you, even if they weren’t.

I understand that he shouldn’t be on everyone’s radar. But it’s past a joke when the nets sign two nobodies and the Pistons grab joe Johnson yet a fully healthy and In shape first ballot hall of gamer can’t get a job. 

I can understand why Portland don’t want him. As he’d shunned them for a couple years. (He wouldn’t lower himself to play in Portland Cos he was arrogant and entitled)

9752,aboooz,t2_gw87o,"I think its pretty obvious who gets cut 

1&amp;2- Ponds and Clemons who will sign 2-way contracts 
3&amp;4- Frazier and Blossomgame who will just sign with our g league team
5- Lastly, Bennent who imo will just get cut full stop unfortunately.

Also I think Ryno is placeholder guy till the buyout market, I think he will be the one getting cut if a better power forward that fits our system becomes available ( for example Marvin Williams), but thats like a bit down the line. I like our squad alot more this season than last.",1569548693,f1l94rm,t3_d9nrp1,/r/rockets/comments/d9nrp1/with_all_this_talk_about_whos_getting_cut_to_make/f1l94rm/,1,rockets,comment
