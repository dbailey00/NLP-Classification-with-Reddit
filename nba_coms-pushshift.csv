13,Superplex123,t2_fnhsa,"&gt; If it was more important to Morey to voice his opinion than to have china's money, then he has the RIGHT to say so.

On top of what you said, it's not even his money he is weighting.  That's LeBron's point.  If it's Morey's money, then by all means he has every right to do it.  But it's not even his money.  So Morey burned billions of dollars of someone else's money, and then we're here like, ""Dude, it's totally worth it man!  This tweet is worth a billion bucks!""

25,devon619,t2_498lp,"Yeah, this is where the disconnect is though. The original issue with Laura Ingraham saying he should shut up and dribble was that she was saying his feelings on matters that were important to him weren't valid because it wasn't his job to comment on those issues. Lebron isn't saying Morey can't tweet what he wants. He simply stated that Morey was misinformed for tweeting by not understanding the consequences. Which is probably the same thing any one with a PR background would have told Morey which is why Morey deleted the tweet.

Lebron probably doesn't know enough about the issue or isn't invested enough about it. If he says nothing we crucify him for taking a stance on a matter that no one expected any NBA player or coach to take a stance on. I can't help but understand where lebron is coming from. The entire PR shit storm is not something I think the NBA expected to deal with before the season started. They are an international league with plenty invested in international markets. If Morey had taken the time to think of how this affected the entire league, meaning players who didn't know enough about the issue, then I think he would have waited to make a statement that had more clarity and wouldn't catch an entire league off gaurd.",1571110824,f3swb0s,t1_f3sqt08,/r/nba/comments/di1ch4/can_someone_explain_this_morey_tweet_situation/f3swb0s/,1,nba,comment

44,LeveonNumber1,t2_2k3c8zst,"You know I've never been a LeBron fan. I kinda felt more the way most NFL fans feel about Brady. I respect his amazing career and will give him his due diligence but I'm not really a fan. But this is the first time I've ever disliked him. I understand the man himself is a business, but to willing participate in an Orwellian goverments narrative in order to protect your $ is disgusting for a a man of Lebrons security and influence. There is no reason for him to this other than greed.

What Tsai, Lebron, and the Chinese goverment say is that this an issue of Chinese sovereignty. Though China has not said this their state run media outlets have heavily implied that American Imperialism is the real influence over the protest. 

The Chinese right to Hong Kong is one of the biggest lies you've ever been told. Just because it is the diplomatic position of the worlds countries doesn't mean it was the just right thing to happen. 

I am not defending imperialism. What was done to the Chinese by western powers in the Victorian age was horrible. But Hong Kong was nothing before the British took the island. The global financial hubs a prosperous city and culture was created by the British and a different, free Chinese people. You see decades of separation off peoples creates different cultures. And while unification of a divided people is great in some circumstances, we must also recognize that it should not be forced upon people's who do not want it. The handover of Hong Kong was presented as the symbolic end of imperialism and the overdue unification of the Chinese people. What was hidden from the world by media narratives was that Hong Kong didn't want to become Chinese, and Britain was forced to give the Island to China due to their economic, military, and diplomatic power. The reason they didn't want to be part of China and why the British tried to give them 50 years of Freedom that China is trying to strip away, is that China is totalitarian goverment that will punish people for what they think. Do not let capitalism fool you.  The government behaves like the western image stereotypic image of a communist nation. Read the agreement that China. China was to maintain Hong Kongs freedom and democracy. They have actively tried to destroy it. In fact they have even tried to destroy Hong Kongers culture. They speak Cantonese, not Mandarin. Yet China is forcing the language on them. That is the reason Hong Kongers are fighting the Chinese goverment. There freedom, their right to democracy and free speech, is actively being taken from them. These are the values that America stands for!

The hypocrisy, to see a man who has spoken out against his own government actively deny other people right to do so is ludicrous. How would you feel if trump was able to silence his crtics with the power of the goverments might. Who would you feel if the press was not allowed to report about his actions in any light they truly see it in? 

That's the reason we value these ideals so much in the west. Sure it sometimes feels like propaganda being shoved in our faces, but if you stop and think about it there's a reason why democracy and the first amendment (and other western nations equivalents) are so important. Do not take them for granted. Actively fight for them. Totalitarianism anywhere cannot be tolerated, especially it not being imposed onto a free society.

If there ever was a such thing as
true evil, it would be the Chinese goverment. That is not a statement about the Chinese peopl, they are not responsible for the goverment for which they are forced to live under. It stands against every value we have fought so hard to earn in history. They suppress your right to think for yourselves.  There is a reason the 21st century is the best time to be alive in recorded history. Do not let is crumble away before your eyes.",1571110840,f3swbt1,t3_di0slk,/r/nba/comments/di0slk/out_of_all_of_the_nbaaffiliated_people_to_comment/f3swbt1/,1,nba,comment

Yes China is fucked up but guess what, you don't say something like that when you have players who are currently in that country, you can put them at risk.

Also, for all the fans that sit here and at, the NBA is only woke when it's about black people...what are you willing to lose?

The NBA needs to change a lot before it sheds China. Who do you think makes the overpriced sneakers you love to wear? Who keeps the games you love to watch streamable and free? Where do you think you're getting your jerseys from....where do you think you get your Amazon orders from? Where do you think you get your clothes and phones and just about anything from?

China is a tough world power. Saying anything other than yessir is basically like slapping them in the face. It will probably take the NBA years to truly pull out of China and setup shop somewhere else. 

When or if that time comes, will you be willing to pay for it? If some basic shoes cost 120 cuz the American worker gets benefits and isn't forced to work 70 hours a week, will you buy those shoes? If the dope color version of a limited edition shoe you want takes a year to come out but costs as much as the Lonzo Ball Z02, will you buy it?

How many of us choose to buy American over a cheaper Chinese product at any point in our lives?",1571110855,f3swchy,t1_f3shkfl,/r/nba/comments/di0jp9/spears_i_believe_he_was_misinformed_and_not/f3swchy/,1,nba,comment

&gt;i was replying to this. specifically. Like you don't get how someone could be a bitch for choosing money over values?

C'mon dude? Basketball is his job and it's what got him in the position he is...why would he jeopardize that? I'm so lost at people right now. So just because he isn't speaking on this issues shows that he has no values? So this **one** topic automatically negates everything else he's done? So **one** thing neutralizes a hundred other things? Smh. This is what I don't get with people, you want these players to say exactly what you want them to say. LeBron knows the PR game and he did his best to navigate it without bringing more issues for the league or himself.

Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production. China has  35-40% of business state owned which is only about 10% higher than U.S - everything else is private.

322,HarryLundt,t2_iwcxm,"Protestors in HK are probably very concerned and mobilized to act on their own accord when they see political repression of the Uyghers. Nonetheless, the two issues are not entirely of a piece. 

There is certainly a general ""trend"" of the CCP maintaining authoritarian political control over its population and elements of that have much to do with both situations.

But there are also particular aspects of both situations that are particular to those situations. How China has repressed the Uyghers in Xinjiang is related to, but not wholly parallel to what they've done in Hong Kong or what they would ever plan to do in Hong Kong.

What do you mean by ""the extradition bill is China creeping on HK significantly""? What presumptions are you making regarding the genesis of the bill and who would propose/pass/enforce it? 

What sort of acts by Hong Kong citizens, in Hong Kong, do you think would be extraditable offenses? If someone in Hong Kong does something that is legal in Hong Kong, but illegal in China, would that be cause for extradition? Do you know which offenses are listed as extraditable? How does that list compare with extradition treaties that Hong Kong and China have with other nations? Do you know which ones were initially included and later struck out due to the lobbying of the business community? Before the entire bill itself was withdrawn.

Have you weighed the potential abuses of extradition for political purposes with the logical law enforcement abilities of extradition? Such as the case of the murderer who confessed to a murder in Taiwan, with which Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement? Or the potential extradition of Hong Kong businessmen who commit crimes of corruption, tax evasion, etc. in China?",1571111061,f3swms0,t1_f3sr34d,/r/nba/comments/di0jp9/spears_i_believe_he_was_misinformed_and_not/f3swms0/,1,nba,comment

342,JQns1b6xUs65,t2_2o2skbnb,"This will probably get downvoted to hell and back, but good to see someone from the western world not obsessed with demonizing China.

So tired of seeing all these ""I respect freedom of speech, but if you like China then you're a facist/dictator/greedy dumbshit."" from all the people who's never been to China/HK and never read about anything on China outside of CNN/FOX (this is coming from someone who's lived in HK for the past 7 years and counting). 

Instead of just looking at fake news, why not do some research on the whole situation? Do you really think it's okay to [throw petrol bombs at the police](https://www.dimsumdaily.hk/20-petrol-bombs-hurled-at-mong-kok-police-station-police-condemn-rioters-for-their-violence/), [cutting throat of random police officer in the name of freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1XQ-Yk2SGc), [plant IED aim to killing the police and anyone nearby](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3032841/duty-hong-kong-police-given-pepper-spray-after)?

Why not look at some independent journalist who actually went to HK and see the protest for themselves

You don't use the words ""misinformed"" or ""not educated"" to refer to somebody not understanding the ramifications of an action. You say something along the lines of ""didn't realize"".

You also have lines like this:

&gt;I just think that when you're misinformed, or you're not educated about something -- and I'm just talking about the tweet itself -- you never know what are the ramifications that can happen.

which pretty clearly illustrates what the ""misinformed"" is referring to. He's misinformed about something, which leads to not understanding the ramifications. This very obviously does not say that he's misinformed about the ramifications.

459,Locked_Out_,t2_fadrt,"Unpopular opinion: Lebron is right in this situation. Morey’s tweet absolutely was dangerous. No one is claiming that he doesn’t have a right to say what he said or that what he said is wrong in the context of first amendment rights. But as a representative of the NBA, this was a dangerous position to take. It’s easy for most us to say that what China is doing is wrong, (which it is) but for Morey to make a statement which he knew would be controversial on behalf of the Rockets, and therefore the NBA, is not okay from an employee standpoint. He has put every owner, manager, and player in an awkward position and that is not okay from a business perspective. Is it okay from a moral perspective? Yes, but he has to realize that this is more than the American objective moral perspective, because other countries do not share our morals.

""and trump has literally not said shit either...""

And now that you've been proven wrong when I have shown you that Trump just sided with Hong Kong at the UN, you're now saying, ""okay, well, yeah, but what has he done?"" Again, you mean outside of the trade war? Yes, the trade war isn't ""about"" the Hong Kong protests, but are you insinuating that we need to escalate above a trade war?

Also, let's go ahead and digest this for a second. And I want you to think critically on your own without falling back on whatever ""tribe"" (Democrat or Republican) you're apart of. Let's look at what was said at the UN.

-clearly in favor of Hong Kong
-treated the Chinese government with respect
-conveyed a message that China can come out of the situation unscathed 
-assured China that a resolution to the issue won't impact China's future

Now, compare what Trump said in the UN speech to what your idea of his comment on the HK/CN issue would be

""i mean it's trump so he's capable of doing all sorts of crazy ""

Uhhh... Yeah, that's gonna be a yikes from me, pal. You were all sorts of off base with this.

And now let's look at the article you are responding with. Didn't we just see the fallout from the Chinese government in regards to Morey's tweet? Do you really want the commander in chief, the leader of the military, to irritate China and not to have everyone in line, in order to ensure that trade negotiations can happen relatively smoothly? If the Chinese government reacted that way to Morey's stance, how are they going to respond if an official or the commander of the military takes a hard line stance? Going back to his UN speech, this is why it was so impactful. It treated China like a super power, was respectful and assuring in tone, but also made it clear where the US sides on the issue. It skated on thin ice perfectly.",1571025167,f3oqc8u,t1_f3oph4n,/r/nba/comments/dhfasg/zucker_gregg_popovich_blasts_cowardly_donald/f3oqc8u/,1,nba,comment

that is the point... and in that regard Trump has not said shit... he basically described the situation... and then when China told him to shutup... he complied...

&gt; “We discussed Hong Kong and I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong, and I’ve been watching and I actually told the vice premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago when I saw a lot of people, and I see far fewer now,” Trump told reporters Friday.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The president said of the demonstrations, “I think that’s going to take care of itself. I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.”  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a “love fest” taking place between and Beijing and Washington, he added.

His camp I went to was very structured. He did lecture/example teaching for like 2 hours. Then followed it up with shooting drills where we were to keep track of our numbers throughout the week. The main thing was we were only to focus on shooting. If we were caught playing 1on1 or and games other shooting games, we’d be kicked out with no refund.

Now, signing with Houston means you'll automatically lose access to the Chinese market. And who knows if you'll regain access after you leave. That's a lot of money and exposure you're giving up by signing with Houston. And I'm sure major shoe brands are going to discourage their athletes from signing in Houston because of this.

1.) Murray and White have to play together. Figure it out. Too much talent there to separate them.

2.) Samanic or Walker have to start showing signs of super star value. Likelihood of this happening this year is low, but next 2 years are important.

3.) DeRozan’s contract has to be priced accordingly. In my opinion he is the perfect successor to Manu as the sixth man. People really disagree with me on that part. Just my opinion.

4.) I think it’s too late for Aldridge. He’s been amazing and deserves a true shot at a title like Gasol. That ain’t happening this year. Ship him at the deadline.

5.) Defense, defense, defense. Versatility and length on the wings. Give us some damn dead eye shooters too (RIP Bertans). Find value in the draft and re-draft situations.

Currently Tencent already paid for their rights for OTT broadcast so the league doesn't have to worry about it for a few years, but when that deal expires it will leave a hole.

1187,ArizonaMildCats,t2_mjzzn,"I think the narrative that he was truly healthy has kind of been put to rest. He got hurt in April of 2012, an ACL is a 9-12 month injury in the NBA so he was in month 12 when he was sitting out of those Nets + Heat series. He didn’t feel right, so he sat. He was 23 and was thinking about the rest of his career, and I think his fears were validated when he tore his meniscus 3 more times after the ACL. 

If anyone is to blame for it, I think it’s the Bulls. They put pressure on him in the media by saying he was cleared and it just put unfair expectations on him. 

I also think it should be noted Derrick Rose actually had a catastrophic knee injury, and that he stayed with the team during it, spoke to the media, and even sat on the bench when he was taking universal criticism for taking precaution with his health. What Kawhi did with the Spurs was much worse than anything Rose did, but no one ever attacks him for it.",1570939737,f3ioeau,t1_f3i9l5a,/r/nba/comments/dh2wxf/derrick_rose_on_last_years_50_point_game_it_made/f3ioeau/,1,nba,comment

1208,PeeOnEon,t2_2ofn1wjw,"It's pretty funny how many of you social media warriors only ever take first steps though lol. But foreal, awareness does lead to change, however what change occurs may be determined by your response. I won't fault someone for thinking about what change they want to see and what the best way to respond is in order to have the desired impact. I won't fault someone for not responding at all if they're unsure whether the change they might incur, with an unthoughtful response, will be more beneficial than no change at all.

Who are we trying to spread awareness to? Our own citizens or the people in China who may or may not know what their government is doing? Do we think losing influential presences there and turning them hostile helps them receive the awareness we're looking to spread? What do you think this is the first step toward exactly? What are your projections for the future if everyone responded the way you think they should? What are the risks? Would you be willing to let this escalate to a complete economic disassociation with China? War with China? Do you know what kinds of effects those things could have on Hong Kong, the US, or the world?

Did you ever consider that, beyond the financial incentives, maybe the NBA thinks they do more good bringing people together globally through sport and further increasing their influence in that region to promote change in another way rather than throwing away access to do a little antagonizing which is unlikely to produce any kind of positive result?",1570939936,f3iotfx,t1_f3i5dj7,/r/nba/comments/dgbsdl/oram_with_lakersnets_playing_saturday_in_shenzhen/f3iotfx/,1,nba,comment

Jokic is never going to be quick and he’s always going to be somewhat susceptible to PnRs and ISOing, which you see a tonne of in the NBA.

I read your last comment, just cbf responding to every point.  


In terms of this part: ""As for me being smug with OP, I haven’t the slightest idea what you’re on about""  


It was the language you used e.g.   
""Ok let me repeat""  
""You have no fucking idea""  
""You’re misusing the fuck out of it""  
""you’ve probably only ever seen it in the context of this subreddit""  


Which I imagine is a large reason for the downvotes that comment got, no one likes that kind of a hubris.

1332,Xhoquelin,t2_13isp1,"In the regular season i think people overstate his offence. He wasn’t really the number one option late consistently. He only just dispelled questions over his engine after his amazing playoffs where it became clear he’s not only their PG but also their most reliable scorer andshooter. Because earlier in the regular season he had games where he’d be gassed out and brick/airball floaters/hook shots late.

And if the Nuggets are going to finish top 4 they should still be trying to make Murray/Harris and maybe even MPJ or Beasley take the reigns late. Jokic can definitely be the primary offence option late like he showed when it mattered in the playoffs, but they need a bit more help so at least for the first half of the season I think they’ll try and give their guards a chance. If they find themselves a chance to miss the playoffs they’ll go through Jokic at the same levels they did in the playoffs.",1570941156,f3irfdo,t1_f3iqqxw,/r/nba/comments/dh5n6e/if_youre_a_gm_and_you_have_the_choice_to_take/f3irfdo/,1,nba,comment

It's not that simple. Curry and Durant have amazing handles which is vital to getting a shot off. NBA defense is no joke and big men who can cover the perimeter are becoming more and more common.

Even without Curry's handles, off ball movement, and playmaking ability Curry's jumpshot will still have a huge impact on Giannis' game, but definitely not as much as in the hands of Curry himself who can use it to its fullest potential.",1570941524,f3isap1,t1_f3ijxqn,/r/nba/comments/dh405r/would_you_rather_have_prime_michael_jordan_or/f3isap1/,1,nba,comment

* Person B: Yeah, I guess, but what about Bill Cosby?

*Redditor A: Wow Kerr's non-stance is weak, he should affirm that no foreign country should be able to silence free expression in the NBA. 
* Redditor B: Well what have you done for Hong Kong? Easy to be so righteous behind your keyboard. 

The issue here is about whether a foreign country should be able to throw their financial weight around to overpower what is supposed to be a core tenant of being a citizen in a free country. Kerr is of much higher profile than the average redditor and actually is an important figure in the NBA, so what he says actually matters and he should be rightly criticized when he stays silent on what could turn out to be a very important precedent.",1570942063,f3itj44,t1_f3gyvte,/r/nba/comments/dgms20/kerr_on_whether_morey_shouldnt_be_fired_i_would/f3itj44/,1,nba,comment

1471,Armadan2,t2_1544nv,"&gt;There is nothing even close to analogous to this in the West.

Try the Puerto Rico protests, which saw millions rise in an even smaller territory, only to be brutalized by police.

I will call total bullshit on the claim of two million protestors. I have watched these protests very closely; that number was essentially an ass-pull by pro-establishment MSM, when actual data scientists using facial recognition software (which counted bystanders as ""protestors"" btw) estimated [only about 250,000,](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/how-many-marched-protests-hong-kong-how-guess-crowd-size.php) or smaller than [the largest pro-China rally.](http://wap.ycwb.com/2019-08/17/content_30318903.htm)

Another analogy are the Yellow Vest protests, which have actually seen thousands injured and over a dozen killed by police, have been going on for more than a year (still counting), and have seen hundreds of thousands of protestors at their peak. The only difference is that the Yellow Vests were not 1/100th as violent as the Hong Kong riots.",1570942492,f3iuk2v,t1_f3d4a7z,/r/nba/comments/dgllqx/steve_kerr_i_have_done_a_lot_of_research_ive/f3iuk2v/,1,nba,comment

the size and demographics of the abuse by usa and china is different. but US and china both treat humans  similarly. Just with more bureaucracy involved in USA. 

US put several of its own citizens, journalists on kill lists and refuses to allow them to challenge it in a court of law on what grounds. 

It tortures others. Has ethnic concentration camps. Police brutality of black ethnic minorities. People thrown in prisons just for profits. Bombs the hell out of other countries, killing children women etc.

HK residents want to be tried in HK for crimes, not on the mainland.  That's because a defendant who is removed from HK will be far from family &amp; support.  Indeed, our own 6th Amended reflects this fact by requiring a trial in the district where the crime is alleged to have been committed.

2. The protesters wanted the bill pulled, and it was.  However, Carrie Lam's original intransigence led to greater demonstrations.

* Kawhi - ""Ballhog and is always hurt""

Yes its all a cynical business but they at least have a chance to do something in their own country. Morey making one tweet doesn't make one iota of a difference in how the Chinese will approach the Hong Kong situation. Trying to get every coach in the league to start shit with China changes nothing. 

What do you want to do about it? Are you going to sign up for the military and petition the government to wage war with China to liberate the Hong Kong people?

I bring this up not to blast Yao Ming, because obviously being a citizen and major face for mainland China is unlikely to make such an unpopular move.

I simply want to make the point that without a figure head and face to get things in motion, it's unlikely something this foreign, both figuratively and literally, would spark the kind of fire that would motivate players.

1802,maethlin,t2_5es79,"I mean, there's a part of me that's p disappointed in Kerr (and anyone else dodging the questions), but not nearly to the degree that most ppl here are going on and on about.

It would be great if there were more ppl to take a Kaepernick-type stand (whether it's Kerr, or Harden, or LeBron, or some of the GMs and such), but on the flipside... I really think for all these guys, there is much more at stake than your own neck/job.

Given China's *extreme* sensitivity around this (and yes, Fuck China for being a giant and very rich twat about it), more incendiary comments doesn't just risk your own career. It also could damn everyone around you... your friends, those who trusted you with a job, those who count on you not to fuck them over, even those who may not be very well off at all.

Say the wrong thing and you might just fuck a very apolitical Klay out of his whole Anta deal. Or if millionaires don't count as people that can be let down, then how about all the schlubs that could and would lose their jobs if the NBA's revenues took a massive hit.

Like when Harden was kindof grovelling there for a bit instead of standing up for his GM, yeah a part of me was thinking ""damn that's a bad look"", but on thinking about it more...  all I could think was how much he represents the whole Rockets organization, how he could fuck over everyone around him by just spouting off.

(This is also why I don't fault Morey at all for retracting what he said... though thankfully not a lot of ppl are shitting on him for that for some reason.) This is a guy who has friends in Hong Kong that he was trying to support and raise awareness for, but when push came to shove... he must have realized he really stirred some shit that would impact damn near everyone in his orbit.

1) Still works with the NFL, the same organization that allegedly blackballed him.

2) Benefits from paying poor people terrible wages to make their shoes and clothing.

So when somebody like Kaep takes a stance where he's standing up for the rights of marginalized people some folks things it's just hypocritical since he's making/taking money from an organization that stomps all over the lives/rights of other marginalized people.

And just to be clear, I'm 100% supportive of Kaepernick and everybody who's knelt.  It's just that these issues (the kneeling, China/HK, etc) aren't as black/white as so many redditors want to make it and it's not as simplistic as people describe it.  Like everything in life, there is nuance and shades a grey.  Progressive freedom fighters aren't 100% good/right and conservative status quo folks aren't 100% bad/wrong.  

Folks sit behind a screen and a username and talk shit about how simple it would be yet they have no clue how they'd actually behave if thrust in a position like Kerr or Harden or Lebron.",1570852694,f3e0c9g,t1_f3dyjfq,/r/nba/comments/dgms20/kerr_on_whether_morey_shouldnt_be_fired_i_would/f3e0c9g/,1,nba,comment

He held opponents to 39.6% shooting as primary defender, down close to 5% from those players yearly average (5% is insaneeeee to effect)

39% is like Jaylen brown 2018 and kawhi Leonard DMVP years holding players 


He made the warriors defense better by 8.9 pts per 100 possessions,  higher than lebron or Kawhi ever effected their teams defense 


He also led the league in steals 



And this while currys team was 2nd in pace in 2016, versus the snail pace of lebrons Miami teams 



All I know, and I may look this up tomororw, is if a player is on the 2nd rated defense with pace adjusted, holds players to under 40% as primary defender , 5% worse than they normally do, and he makes his teams defense better by 8.9 pts per 100 possesions (Goberts first defensive mvp he made jazz better by 6.8 pts per 100 on defense for comparison) 


I'll guarentee those things if anyone has done them,  not only is considered good on defense, they would of made all defensive team that year 



I'll almost guarentee any guard that's a  starter that hold players to even 41% and under, made their team defense better by 3.0 pts or more, and led league in steals made all defense.....and currys doing that x2 on a run and gun team

You mostly post in anime and fortnite subreddits. 

You are 22 and single (I wonder why) and resort to r4r to find a match. 

You expect your significant other (if you ever get one) to dress conservatively for you. 

You somehow equate racism to drug addiction which should be rehabbed?? 

You defend pedophilia to the age of 16. 

You think beauty is the ultimate privilege likely implying you blame a lot of your shortcomings on your looks. 

You post in conservative and republican subreddits and get offended by anything else so you’re clearly not just right of center.

Kerr in 2017

&gt;‘The NBA, I think, is at the forefront of social activism as far as the major sports are concerned,’’ Kerr said. ‘‘I’m very proud of the work that Adam Silver’s doing and the league’s doing. They back up what they believe in, and I think that’s important.’’

&gt;""For a long time, a lot of athletes have kind of stayed out of the political forum out of fear of losing customers,’’ Kerr said. ‘‘I think it’s refreshing that we have athletes who are putting their social agenda, social beliefs, ahead of any marketing issues. I think that’s powerful.’",1570765580,f3a9tp2,t1_f3a8y6h,/r/nba/comments/dg7mqi/kerr_responds_to_donald_trumps_tweet/f3a9tp2/,1,nba,comment

2318,WheresMyCarr,t2_4qvvxd01,"\&gt;  I just don't understand why absolutely anyone gives a shit about these guys opinions. 

Honestly, even though I posted this comment, I don't really care either. Unfortunately, so many people do, and it does kind of make sense, people look up to these stars. So if you want to reach them, you need to play the game. Awareness is huge.

\&gt;  It kinda makes sense when they live in America and they grew up here,  some from pretty shitty parts of the country. They are commenting on  their past, their countries present, and its potential future. 

Totally reasonable.

\&gt;  Literally there ONLY connection to China, is their business dealings, because it allows them to have a profitable pre-season. 

Someone who has come from such places as you mentioned above should definitely see the parallel between their struggles and those of the people of Hong Kong. I'd almost go as far to say it should put in perspective how much worse off these people in Hong Kong really are, and how much they could use the attention gathered by someone of Harden's status talking about it.

Today at work I was talking about this issue with two people, and neither of them had any idea of any specifics in any of this. They both said something along the lines of ""Yea, I heard some shit about China recently."" Both of these guys are huge NBA fans, and when Harden speaks, they listen.

\&gt;  It's like ya'll are just salivating at the mouth for a player to say  ""Fuck China"" like that will do absolutely anything but make their  individual lives more difficult, and literally improve not a single  persons well being. 

James Harden and his immediate family are going to have very easy lives for the next couple generations. He has that kind of fuck you money. Again, awareness is huge, and when you play politics and activism sometimes, it should look bad the times you choose not to for the sake of money.

\&gt;  The players want to talk about what the players want to talk about, they  should not be EXPECTED to comment on anything, they are FUCKING  basketball players lol 

I mostly agree with this statement. Maybe I am expecting too much. But they weren't just basketball players when who ever the hell said ""shut up and dribble"".",1570765706,f3a9yr0,t1_f3a9bq7,/r/nba/comments/dfy7x0/free_talk_thread/f3a9yr0/,1,nba,comment

I mean, I wish he was more outspoken on China too, but tbf the question directed at him was probably explicitly about Trump's tweet on him.  So he was technically on topic there. 

&gt;Where as three simple words like ""I support Hong Kong"" will result in the Warriors being unpersoned in China.

Which tbh is a pretty good reason not to say those words.  I mean, in his shoes, while I might be willing to take the financial hit from a China banning myself, I wouldn't really be willing to inflict that same economic damage on the rest of my organization, especially as many of them might not be able to afford it.",1570765720,f3a9zbf,t1_f3a4yo0,/r/nba/comments/dg7mqi/kerr_responds_to_donald_trumps_tweet/f3a9zbf/,1,nba,comment

2420,BScottyJ,t2_h73yd,"&gt; It starts with us carrying about the people being oppressed, and that requires a cultural shift. I don't know about you, but the NBA being involved in this has gotten me to become far more educated and opinionated on China and the issues it is causing for people.

I'm aware of the issues it is causing people, but as I stated I really don't see how we can *do* anything. China is an extremely powerful country and the U.S. is not in a position to go against them, and lose a significant amount of money - and lives - trying to stop oppression that is happening in their own country. If it gets to the point where China is affecting us beyond threatening to pull out business deals then I'm all for doing something consequences be damned. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, and there is something we *can* do, but I don't believe I am at this point in time.

&gt; Kerr is in a position of cultural influence. By speaking out he brings attention to the issue, and gets us to care more. Which is what he did with other social issues, and Trump in general, but is not doing here.

Kerr is in a position to speak his mind on issues that affect people in his own country. He is not in a position to speak about issues that could help result in loss of revenue in the NBA, and as a result jobs of people who have nothing to do with it. I understand wanting to say something and speak out, but I also understand not wanting to put yourself in a position where people blame you for losing their job.",1570765827,f3aa3oa,t1_f3a9cf1,/r/nba/comments/dg7mqi/kerr_responds_to_donald_trumps_tweet/f3aa3oa/,1,nba,comment

The only bill I saw proposed was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would sanction the Chinese if need be and allow special visa rights to Hong Kong people seeking asylum. 

Now, should we do those things? Of course, it obviously better than nothing.

Maybe I was coming off kinda dickish, but I just think some people may be expecting too much out of this situation. We can and should stand by Hong Kong, but I feel as if some people don’t realize there really is so much we can do. The Chinese government is fucking demented. They would sooner kill themselves than to lose to the capitalist powers. 

And I think it’s great that people are raising awareness on this issue but I don’t really like how it’s turned us against each other, as if people need to validate that they support democracy. Rather than fighting to end the human rights abuses in China, what we should be doing is fighting for our rights to talk about the issue freely and fighting against immoral business dealings by US corporations.

I agree that the courts should have more of a say in determining who gets extradited on a case-by-case basis instead of having that power rest solely with the chief executive. I agree that this is a step in the wrong direction for HK given the current judicial environment in the PRC. 

I started this whole conversation to shine a light on how much background there really is and how it is unreasonable to expect Steph Curry to know this much about what the protests are about, why the protests are occurring, and why both China and HK might feel upset about what each views as a violation of their respective sovereignty.

2843,Smellmyhand,t2_5fmkw,"Dude this is a societal problem right now and it's becoming dangerous and terrifying. Basically if you aren't speaking out against something, you are obviously for it. That's hardly ever the entire story. Social media has made it so everyone can voice their opinion at a moment's notice. And it doesn't even have to be a well researched opinion. But it doesn't matter because you'll still get attention and praise for it because you ""spoke out"". But if you stay silent, it somehow means you aren't against that thing. That's bullshit. It's incredibly damaging to our society. It is perfectly ok to just say ""I don't know and I'm not the one to ask.""

I absolutely support the right for LGBT people to do whatever they want in their personal lives and with their bodies. But I'm not going to post about it or really ever bring it up in conversation because I'm a straight white male with nothing to add. But there's people now who say my silence means I don't support them. There's people now who say because I didn't add the Q or whatever to when I wrote 'LGBT' earlier it means I don't support them. And I take the Niemöller poem to heart, I think it's our responsiblity to speak up when called upon to support each other and make each other feel accepted and safe. But maybe me shutting the fuck up gives air for someone who is actually a part of that group to speak for themselves. Maybe my opinion shiouldn't be the one that matters when I'm not the one being discriminated against or trampled by my government. 

And to your point, these are athletes. It's fucking sad that we have stooped so low that we are so concerned with the thoughts of celebrities. Like you said, there's not a single word that Bron or Steph could say that's going to turn shit around. And if you're one of the ones waiting with bated breath to speak up, make sure you're doing something to help those people too.",1570679609,f35jm3j,t1_f34wyfs,/r/nba/comments/dfnhcr/steph_curry_this_situation_theres_a_huge_weight/f35jm3j/,1,nba,comment

2888,EstebanTrabajos,t2_4yub3,"People are criticizing them for putting money over human rights.  Especially when the league gives itself such a socially conscious, holier than thou image, it reeks of hypocrisy.  It's easy to stand up for whats right when it doesn't cost you anything, but when the league, players, and coaches had their chips on the table, they decided to shut up and dribble instead of losing out on some money when they are already wealthier than entire third world countries.  It makes them look no better mob wives.  Here's just a sneak peak of some of China's greatest hits of recent years:

* Hundreds of human rights lawyers (not even dissidents, just the LAWYERS who defended people) were snatched by gestapo all over China in what is known as the [709 Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/709_crackdown).

* One of those lawyers, Wang Quanzhang was [sentenced to 4.5 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/wang-quanzhang-china-sentences-human-rights-lawyer-to-four-years-in-prison) for ""subversion of state power"". But that's not enough. China actually [went after Wang's 6-year-old son](https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/), forcing him out of his school and banning any other school from taking him in.

* A dissident, [Wang Bingzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Bingzhang_(dissident\)) was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison after a closed trial that lasted 1 day.

* A man wore a t-shirt with the word ""Xitler"" on it and [was disappeared](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/03/young-chinese-activist-missing-after-sharing-plan-to-wear-xitler-t-shirt-on-cpc-anniversary-report/). Eventually he was [tried for ""subversion of state power"" while barred from meeting with lawyers](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/15/chinese-xitler-activist-trial-subversion-lawyers-barred-seeing/)

* Another man, [Wang Meiyu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/death-of-chinese-activist-in-police-custody-prompts-calls-for-investigation-into-torture) hold up a placard calling for Xi’s resignation &amp; democracy. He was arrested for ""picking quarrels”. He ended up dead in custody.

* A woman live streamed herself [splashing ink on a Xi poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sF34fJwh0). She was [disappeared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-woman-dong-yaoqiong-disappears-spraying-ink-xi-jinping-a8455166.html). Her last social media update: *""Right now there are a group of people wearing uniforms outside my door. I’ll go out after I change my clothes. I did not commit a crime. The people and groups that hurt me are the ones who are guilty""*. Later on there was report of her being [sent to a psychiatric hospital](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/23/chinese-protester-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-poster-sent-psychiatric-hospital-report/)

* After the ink-splash woman's disappearance her father made a series of broadcast to call attention to her plight. He ended up getting [taken away by the police in the middle of a live stream](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/14/police-interrupt-youtube-live-stream-father-missing-chinese-woman-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-photo/)

* 5 people associated with a Hong Kong bookstore that sold titles such as ""*Xi Jinping and His Six Women*"" were [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Only one managed to escape back to HK. He held a press briefing to tell the world about his kidnapping by China. He's now in exile in Taiwan. The other 4 are still somewhere in China.

And, of course

* [1.5 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ) Uyghurs rounded up in concentration camps

* Genocide through [forced abortions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) on Uyghur women

* [Sexual torture](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) of Uyghur women such as rape &amp; rubbing intimate parts with chili paste.

* [Leaked footage](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d722aw/chinas_detention_of_uighurs_video_of_blindfolded/) of a large number of blindfolded Uyghurs shackled together

* A Canadian journalist [wanted to debunk reports of Chinese anti-Muslim repression so he went on a stage-managed show tour put on by China](https://nationalpost.com/news/canadian-went-to-china-to-debunk-reports-of-anti-muslim-repression-but-was-shocked-by-treatment-of-uyghurs). That means he only saw a fake Potemkin village that China actually thought was acceptable by Western standard. But the brutality of even this fake Potemkin village stunned him. Now imagine what's really happening in the real concentration camps where millions of Uyghurs are being held. Imagine how bad the true situation is.

* Using minorities &amp; political prisoners as [free organ farms](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c1my5j/china_is_harvesting_organs_from_detainees_uk/). A doctor's [eye witness account](https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/chinese-dissidents-are-being-executed-for-their-organs-former-hospital-worker-says/): *'The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive. The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his two kidneys. Then the doctor ordered Zheng to remove the man’s eyeballs. Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and Zheng froze. “I can’t do it,” he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man’s eyeballs himself.'*

* Call for [retraction of 400 Chinese scientific papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners) amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners

* [15 Chinese studies retracted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/15-15-studies-retracted-due-to-fears-they-used-chinese-prisoners-organs/) due to fears they used Chinese prisoners' organs

* [Cultural genocide (and organ harvests, of course)](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-uyghur-muslim-rules-laws-treatment-chinese-human-rights-religion-a8534161.html). A uyghur's testimony: *""First, children were stopped from learning about the Quran, then from going to mosques. It was followed by bans on ramadan, growing beards, giving Islamic names to your baby, etc. Then our language was attacked – we didn’t get jobs if we didn’t know Mandarin. Our passports were collected, we were told to spy on each other, innocent Uyghur prisoners were killed for organ harvesting""*

* China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority Hui Muslim. ['Afraid We Will Become The Next Xinjiang': China's Hui Muslims Face Crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown): *""The same restrictions that preceded the Xinjiang crackdown on Uighur Muslims are now appearing in Hui-dominated regions. Hui mosques have been forcibly renovated or shuttered, schools demolished, and religious community leaders imprisoned. Hui who have traveled internationally are increasingly detained or sent to reeducation facilities in Xinjiang.""*",1570679706,f35jq1i,t3_dfsbx3,/r/nba/comments/dfsbx3/the_amount_of_backseat_criticism_on_people_like/f35jq1i/,1,nba,comment

The Chinese government sucks and commits human rights atrocities on a daily basis and has for decades.  That isn’t in contention.

Is that what you meant by history? Whereas the vast majority of American involvement in the middle east has occurred post WWII and has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the instability that is currently plaguing the region. 911 is terrible but to compare it to Nanking is absurd. They are two totally different situations with different causes and results. Are the Paris attacks in anyway similar in impact and scale, despite being very similar in terms of the goals of the perpetrators and the reasons behind what they did? Fuck no, there is a large difference between 911 and that and you fucking know it you bloody fucking idiot. According to your logic, 911 is just as bad as the holocaust because their intents were somewhat similar. Both are bad, but let's be fucking real here. There's only so much you can pull with the relativity card.

If I am the shill that you claim me to be, it's pretty sad how little you know of world history for a supposedly enlightened and free person.

3016,Lou_Peachum,t2_3zyn7du0,"This is such a bs point and low effort post to kill any discussion.

Hell, Kerr is already a multimillionaire with some of the best job security in the world; if the Warriors were that stupid to fire him, any other NBA team not the Nets would hire him. If he got fired and never worked again, he'd be completely fine and continue to live a life financially better off than 0.1% of all Americans.

The average Joe that you critique ""types this from the comforts of their reddit account"" legit can't do anything about it; most of us here don't have the luxury to get fired and then ever work again.

If anything, if these figures are getting paid millions, I'd expect them to open their mouths, especially one as vocal about social justice as Kerr.

If he wants to stand there, critique the US President - as he very much should - and receive all the praise/good publicity that comes from a low effort/low risk talking point, then I expect him to critique China as well, especially since he doesn't even need to address the HK/China situation. If he wants to stand back from geopolitical shitstorm that is HK/China, whatever; but the issue here that's actual close to home is how the NBA's involvement in China has forced the NBA's hand - and has forced other Americans to keep their opinions silenced for the sake of money.

Morey has had to delete his tweet and backtrack. Silver initially put up one of the weakest responses to toe the line right in the middle, before taking a stance against China.

That's what we want him to speak about.",1570592459,f323m6c,t1_f320ziq,/r/nba/comments/dfaotu/bill_simmons_steve_kerrs_father_was_assassinated/f323m6c/,1,nba,comment

3128,___Waves__,t2_3yvk7lre,"You're confusing China being the company that currently has basically all the world's capacity to mine it's rare earths with China being the only country that possess rare earths. The US itself has tons of rare earths within its own borders and was actually the leading exporter of it until as late as the 80s. It just doesn't exact them anymore because it is process that causes a lot of pollution so it's mines were mostly shut down and the production moved to China which like the US has a lot of rare earth but had less of a concern about the pollution. Again you're thinking in the short term and that's not what this conversation is about. 

&gt;[As trade tensions rise between the U.S. and China, rare earth minerals are once again in the political spotlight. Today Chinese mines and processing facilities provide most of the world's supply, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hinted about using this as political leverage in trade negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. But in the long run, many experts say the global market involving these materials would likely survive even if China completely stopped exporting them.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-panic-about-rare-earth-elements/)

Hell this part is from your own link so read it better next time:

&gt;It would take years to build enough processing plants to match China’s processing capacity of 220,000 tonnes - which is five times the combined capacity of the rest of the world.

3164,John-the-Gardener,t2_zapq9w3,"&gt; The reason why people in other countries get agitated is that America seems to be focused on human rights abuses everywhere but its own backyard, what it's doing.   Now nothing stops you from doing so, but you can't not expect people to call you a hypocrite when doing so.

Sure, our government’s definitely not perfect, but don’t call me, random citizen of America, a hypocrite for the sins I didn’t commit. You certainly shouldn’t disregard any opinion I have based on my nationality.

&gt; Here's the thing, there has been no reaction by the chinese government.  All of this is reactions by corporations in response to a mob of angry chinese netizens.  The Chinese government couldn't give a flying fuck about what Daryl Morey says.  The conspiracy theory that's prevalent is that every single entity in China is somehow taking orders from the CCP is just farcical and shows a complete ignorance of how China actually works.

Okay, so this is my thought process:

CCP stands for “Chinese Communist Party,” I understand. I also understand that this party has a singular authoritarian rule of the country. The means of production are state-owned under certain communist regimes, so it would follow that I shouldn’t trust supposedly government independent corporatians that could very well be government puppets.

As someone who seems well informed on Chinese government, please tell me how I’m being ignorant.",1570592851,f3241sy,t1_f31zdb2,/r/nba/comments/det2cn/yoon_chinese_basketball_association_confirms_it/f3241sy/,1,nba,comment

I can't follow this logic!

While it is true article 26 of HK basic law states that all residents of the HK SAR will have the right to vote it leaves a lot of grey area for how elections are to be run.


A neutral source to read up on this further:
https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/was-hong-kong-ever-promised-democracy-fact-check/5809964


At the moment HK residents do have the right to vote however they feel their voting power is diluted due to companies in different sectors having votes too. And they feel that the candidates they are allowed to choose from are only those that are pre-approved by the CPC. None of which explicitly violate the rules of HK Basic Law.


The biggest issue here however is not whether they get to have fairer votes now or not.

For the vast majority of Hong Kong's history, any Chinese who came to Hong Kong had less freedom than the British/other Europeans there, and they achieved true universal suffrage.  For most of Hong Kong's existence, the colony had two sets of laws, one for Europeans and one for the Chinese.  [Chinese were not allowed to live in the most desirable districts, and all laws were written only in English despite the vast majority of the population being only able to speak Cantonese](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2348771).  When Chinese Hong Kongers protested against British colonial rule in 1966, [the British put them down with force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots).  

Despite became a British colony in 1841, (and despite the UK itself granting all citizens over the age of 21 voting rights in 1918), Hong Kong only got the right to vote for even a portion of their legislative council in 1991, 150 years after colonization.  Even then, they could only vote for [18 seats out of the total 60 legislative council seats](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/was-hong-kong-ever-promised-democracy-fact-check/5809964) (although this number was increased to 30 in 1995) and only certain sections of Hong Kong could vote for these seats.

3407,YunKen_4197,t2_4oz9vfv1,"I don't support the HK protests whatsoever.  However, this is no longer about the HK protests but rather about the slippery slope of self-censorship and compromising core American values.  No matter if you are a liberal or conservative, liberatarian or socialist, I think we can all agree that the first amendment is an important issue.  

I have seen many videos regarding NBA China and NBA players in China - and I can see that they are as fervent and dedicated as any American fans.  I am genuinely heartbroken for the Chinese fans who face the prospect of losing the NBA.  Yes they can always stream the games but imagine being banned from wearing your team's jersey when you go out, not being able to buy gear, being shut out of the NBA community, and relegated to the outside looking in.  But I have to agree 100% with Max.

\---SAS twisting himself in to a pretzel only to circle back time and again ""but money though""

\---Whataboutism by SAS regarding Rosa Parks and Arab Israeli conflict - both cringey especially given he's talking to a Jew.  The comparisons don't make sense to me. 

\---in a later video SAS remarks that common people are never expected to comment on the Arab Israeli conflict or other world issues.  True, but he fails to recognize that the US has an intimate relationship with China and Morey's comments are therefore more relevant in that regard.  ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5iA9xeAgPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5iA9xeAgPI) )

The Nets have accomplised far more in the past 20 years than the Knicks:

**Nets - 2 finals appearances, 10 playoff berths, made it past the first round 6 of those times**

**Knicks - 5 playoff berths, only once did they make it out the first round**

&gt;**&gt;**The Nets have made great decisions in the last couple of years but that doesn’t erase the years of mediocrity, who by the way, have been worse than ours

Our lows have been lower but highs have been far higher than the Knicks.

This guy [got it right](https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2019/10/07/yes-boycott-garbage-nba-china-ass-kissing/) IMO:

&gt;Yeah, I’m aware that a mass boycott of one of the four major sports isn’tgoing to happen, especially with Zion Williamson debuting this season and lots of intriguing off-season roster shuffles. And if a mass boycott ever did happen, it wouldn’t be triggered by a dispute in a foreign country on the other side of the world.

&gt;This isn’t a “we’ll make this happen!” rallying cry. This is an argument that it should happen. If the only moral language these venal scumbags understand is money, then the obvious thing to do is send them a message in that language.

&gt;Scout’s honor: I was going to buy a league pass to watch the games this year because of Zion and Ja Morant and to follow the new-look Lakers and Clippers. After this, not one dime. Philip Klein gets to the heart of my disgust. It’s not just the kowtowing to China that’s repulsive, it’s the cumulative hypocrisy of one “woke” American industry after another congratulating themselves for their progressive activism here at home while lapping up Chinese blood money. Mass internment of Chinese Muslims, organ harvesting, religious oppression, an ever more intrusive surveillance state, and no one says a word — until finally Hong Kongers stand up for their rights and the NBA’s moral degenerates rush to take sides with the oppressor.

&gt;F*** these people, one and all. Sometimes that’s all you can say.

He goes on to make an excellent critique of Tsai's piece.

Anywya, even though a boycott isn't going to happen, people should express their outrage and make decisions at the margin being aware of the issue. I grew disenchated with the CCP about 10-15 years ago when things started going backwards. They've been getting worse in the last few years and that has affected my decisions, even if I don't ""boycott China"".

But I'll keep speaking out against the CCP, I'll keep making politicians stances on the CCP and how to deal with it a major factor on my voting decisions, I'll keep promotingthe idea of decoupling from China as long as the CCP is in power and I'll keep beind mindful of major Chinese companies that are mere CCP peons, including Huawei, Alibaba and so on.",1570506042,f2z4asc,t1_f2yv4qg,/r/nba/comments/des8nt/the_athletic_didnt_post_on_the_china_story_all/f2z4asc/,1,nba,comment

3526,lobsterpizzzzza,t2_3e310zpb,"I think some ways to trigger them would be 

1) if your government is so great, why can’t you guys get laid and married? 

Oh right because you KILLED off the girls and now you have way too many dudes and not enough women. 

No wonder all you guys just stay in cyber cafes. Probably you will need to be homosexuals since there aren’t enough women to go around. 

2) if China is so great, why do you have to use a VPN to talk to anyone else outside of China lol? No one wants to use wechat or Weibo - you live in a sandbox. 

3) China is just not original - you can make a lot of stuff but you just copy and mix it all together. There are so many Frankenstein characteristics in their products. Like Pizza In China is so weird - they’ll just throw ANYTHING on it. Or Chinese 8 ball - they mixed 8 ball pool with snooker. 

4) Chinese are not original thinkers 

I remember a story in college when a professor had a Chinese student who was really smart and could read off all the material from other scholar. He could tell the professor exactly what different scholars on the subject think. 

But then the professor asked him, “what do YOU think?” The student was speechless and was like “what?...I don’t know what I think” and had like a mini mental breakdown. 

5) bring up the yulin dog meat festival. If China was so great, why do they still allow dogs to be electrocuted and tortured ? You can’t even shut down one stupid festival. 

6) talk about how they dress like dumb Hicks which is what they do. Mainland Chinese have no taste, especially the rich kids. They just buy the tackiest with the biggest price tags and it doesn’t even go together. As long as it says Gucci or LV, they’ll wear sandals with it.",1570506072,f2z4c1a,t1_f2z1pre,/r/nba/comments/dess3b/chinese_netizens_reactions_to_morey/f2z4c1a/,1,nba,comment

I'm not trying to be the arbiter of what threshold a human rights violation must cross for the NBA to comment. What I would want is for the NBA to have a consistent set of political values that they stick to and, when a certain issue is especially relevant, as Hong Kong is now and police brutality cases have been in the past (and will be in the future), take appropriate action based on those values. Obviously under capitalism this is highly unrealistic but that would be the goal.

In the foreword:
&gt;quote Another power is a far greater threat to freedom—and that  is  China.  The  Chinese  Communist  Party  has  grown  increasingly  despotic  and  imperialistic  in  recent  years;  it  brutally enforces its model of totalitarianism at home and seeks to spread it globally. It employs a nasty array of military  aggression,  intimidation,  imprisonment,  and  execution  of  opponents  domestically,  with  increasingly  blatant  use of those tools against external opponents. Its economic  clout  is  used  to  bribe,  corrupt,  intimidate,  and  indebt  nations around the world.

The foreword explains and outlines the threat of China. Read the whole thing.

&gt;quote Thousands  demonstrate  in  Hong  Kong  for  freedom  and  vote  for  independence-minded  candidates  who  want  nothing to do with mainland totalitarianism. This opposition has led to growing mainland interference, which is undermining freedom.

3895,SeaynO,t2_qbr9ihi,"In this first four years, LeBron played 20 first round games. Michael Jordan played 15. You can act like an entire fourth of the potential games, are ridiculous but it's not. Every year in the playoffs, that's between 1-4 games of difference. If you're averaging 30 ppg then that's 30-120 points of difference per year. That's an extra 150 points of differential between Jordan and LeBron because of the difference in 4 years.

650 points of advantage is large when we're talking about 8000, points. That's like a twelfth of the total. LeBron is already on his 16th season. Michael scored approximately 1000 points less than LeBron in the playoffs. That means LeBron had an extra season to do it but that doesn't give context either because LeBron also had more games per playoffs to do it in. 

In conclusion, yeah it makes a difference. Like wtf. How do you think that doesn't count. Not to mention including playoffs totals doesn't make sense because it gives you a negative for ending series earlier. Like the 2016-17 warriors scored more per game than the 17-18 warriors in the playoffs but also played 4 fewer games. Should the 17-18 warriors get accolades for scoring more total points?

**In addition, Tencent Sports announced Sunday that all live streaming and news reporting of the Rockets would be suspended. The company gave customers who bought a subscription to watch Houston games online the opportunity to pick another NBA team**""

*(Actually capitalism)

I don't agree with the post you were replying to, communism has zero to do with China's rabid nationalism. But China's sincere attempt to implement communism was a major reason _why it was an agricultural backwater in the first place_. It rose from a second-rate power suffering from civil war and Japanese invasion in the 1930's, all the way to a simple second-rate power in the 1970's, thanks to Mao's communism. Then Deng Xiaoping said ""Hey, let's go ahead and be totally capitalist, but keep calling ourselves communist anyway"" and the country boomed and became a superpower.

If you can go to China today and say ""A-ha! Communism in action!"" then I have a Narnia to sell you.",1570419669,f2ulb1u,t1_f2uisw1,/r/nba/comments/debd72/us_presidential_candidate_yang_blasts_chinese/f2ulb1u/,6,nba,comment

Lastly, the reason the NBA felt compelled to put out a statement was to save face amongst it’s Chinese fans and partners.

This is actually not accurate at all. The emergency law was in place to deal with rioting. The law gives the governor temporary power to install laws he/she see fit to maintain public order. At the same time, the legislative review starts and they will eventually decide if the law is allowed or not, possibly after a few weeks/months.

4304,Ziddletwix,t2_4jl9s,"This is not a Streisand effect situation, like people are saying. China’s goal is not to make people not see Morey’s tweet, and make sure it gets deleted. The literal tweet doesn’t matter. The purpose of this is to send a message, to show their clout and influence, and to demonstrate that prominent American figures should refrain from commenting on the situation. 

This strategy *wants* media coverage of this. The whole point is that China is demonstrating how effectively it will actually commit to these tactics (many countries complain, few actually take action like this). 

This is very very different than the Streisand effect. If China actually cared about the literal tweet, and this was just a means to get it deleted, then that would be relevant. As is, media coverage is expected and desired. They’ll be frustrated that Morey wasn’t fired (assuming he isn’t), but heartened that they were able to bully an apology out of him and the NBA. 

On the whole, this Mostly worked. They didn’t get total compliance, but they was no mass uprising among the stars. and the NBA showed quite a bit of deference. Future public figures are going to be a lot more careful about how they address Hk.",1570420228,f2uly3s,t1_f2uh838,/r/nba/comments/ded82f/the_nba_posted_a_different_statement_to_its/f2uly3s/,127,nba,comment

Realize there is the players union, coaches union, 30 different owners, corporate stakeholders and the commissioners office. Adam Silver can make certain unilateral decisions but he has to answer to ALL of the stakeholders he represents. 

You’re acting like Adam Silver benevolently picks and chooses which issues he wants to support. The NBA doesn’t “allow” Lebron to have an opinion, they have no choice because the Players union is a powerful stakeholder who protect Lebron’s right to be outspoken. 

And  your point 3. Yes, this is how corporations work. All corporations answer to their stakeholders. Adam Silver is no different , he is only commissioner because the owners ratified him. It’s a privilege not his right. If they don’t like what he’s doing they could remove him in a second and no one would stop them. In this situation, Adam Silver is doing the bidding of the owners who have no desire to run afoul of Chinese sponsorships.

4420,jl359,t2_wbjw9,"I guess me and my entire family in Xinjiang would be arrested already. We did shit on the CCP on multiple occasions both in public and on dinner tables, no one really gave a damn and it’s not like we’re planning to overthrow the government or something.

I’m not sure if you understand the [extent of the violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_conflict) during the Hu Jintao era in Xinjiang. The CCP response is a complete overreaction, but because of the context behind it the proportion of the population who are OK enough such that they’ll keep quiet (not to mention that Western press severely exaggerate the facts; my grandparents had to go to classes every two weeks to basically listen to propaganda).

The fact is, the general opinion of the CCP nowadays is better than it was during during the Hu Jintao days because people saw tangible economic growth. It’s the cumulation of that, 70 years of pro-CCP propaganda and the fact that what the Turkestan extremists did were completely unacceptable to those who are not strong believers of the religion (which there aren’t many, since the influence of religion have dwindled since 1949). The media paints a picture of a Xinjiang that is on the verge of independence - it is not. Its best opportunity was in the 70s and 80s.

I’ll probably be downvoted, called a chinese shill (yes I post on r/Sino), and it’s unlikely many will change their perception of Xinjiang from what I said. But if your default behaviour when met with something that’s opposite of your perception is to ensure that others don’t see it/dislike it (by the way, not what downvoting is for), then perhaps you’re just not as open to new things as you think.",1570420444,f2um6mt,t1_f2ul4iw,/r/nba/comments/ded82f/the_nba_posted_a_different_statement_to_its/f2um6mt/,3,nba,comment

4427,TonySoprano300,t2_z5c4k,"Lol that’s data dude. Why would it matter if it’s from YouTube? It also charts nearly every defensive possession of Draymond guarding AD. So either you don’t know what cherry picking is or you haven’t looked at the footage or your being willfully ignorant because your too proud to acknowledge you were wrong on something and you don’t much like the idea that there are people who can guard AD

Also copy pasted? So what if it’s copy pasted? How else do I link data? 



The cherry pick thing is obviously a defense mechanism at this point

I disagree, how are they fallacious arguments? If it’s that obvious you should be able to explain it. 

Ok he dropped 30 on good efficiency in multiple playoff series, that still doesn’t mean they didn’t guard him well. To evaluate NBA defense that is way is pretty much street mentality, it’s the type of thing you’d hear at the local YMCA facility. When we actually look at comprehensive footage and analyze it we get a clear understanding of defensive impact. Footage is the best way to measure individual defense as stats are susceptible to too many factors that can affect the integrity of the data. 

What facts have I ignored? I gotta say that’s very interesting coming from a guy who literally did just that


As opposed to you who has displayed no evidence of anything and just keeps pointing out the raw stat of AD averaging 30. I really don’t think you’re in a position to criticize anybody’s ability to site evidence 

I do think that, and so does the warriors coaching  staff which includes Steve Kerr who is one of the top coaches in the NBA and one of the most successful coaches in NBA history. I guess he’s delusional too because he actually put him on AD/Lebron at times during the game

4447,jurconpol,t2_164ap5,"Absolutely, again, he took down the tweet. I could be wrong but I seriously doubt that was of his own accord especially when his owner quoted the tweet and distanced himself from those comments. I think NBA owners and shoe companies making it clear to their employees that they are not to take a stance on this issue is a fair assumption to make. And again, my original point was that an NBA player speaking out on this issue is far from a slippery slope to them having to take a position on every international issue which is what OP's argument was. In this case, the situation is directly tied to an NBA GM, what's even more chilling is the fact that apparently it's now being reported that ownership considered replacing Morey. This is a huge deal to me, it genuinely makes me sick to my stomach, I don't care how much I get downvoted it's just my opinion.

Not much different from some American people on this sub relate to the US. First step to nationalism is a strong relation to the country so your citizenship becomes personal identity. When people talk about the atrocities of US governments on this sub, a lot of American people show strong counter-reaction to that and reply with stuff like ""We aren't that bad"". ""We"" because of the said relation despite the fact that they haven't committed those actions. Anyway, those people on the sub would show even more harsh reaction &amp; commit to their image of the country even more if people said ""Fuck the US"" along with pointing out US history and present from a moral perspective. That comment would be downvoted to oblivion no matter the context for instance, on this sub it would. 

Anyway, from my limited perspective, the situation with Chinese ""nationalism"" is not much different.

Like, Pat Connaughton also contributed positively last year. If we dropped him without replacing him with a comparable player, we would also be worse. But I guarantee people wouldn’t be losing their shit about how much of a mistake losing Pat Connaughton was.

Brogdon is most certainly a lot better than Connaughton, but the idea remains the same - he isn’t as good as people think he is, our system, coaching and depth is strong enough that we can approximate much of his value through other players on the team, and (not yet mentioned in this conversation but still relevant) we’re likely to improve in other areas through other acquisitions and progression from young players, so the impact of Brogdon leaving is going to be minimal.",1570333649,f2ouskf,t1_f2ol4cj,/r/nba/comments/ddoy6i/malcolm_brogdon_is_a_nice_role_player/f2ouskf/,0,nba,comment

4614,Downisthenewup87,t2_pfiie,"Several interesting quotes here:

1) “We had the lineup with me, Gary and Jamal and Paul and he was there,” Jokic said. “We were just moving and cutting. He just didn’t know what to do. We told him, when you’re standing, you’re wrong. Whatever you do, just move.”

That’s exactly what Malone has told him.
“As we move the ball, he’s gotta understand cutting through the lane and finishing that cut and spotting back up, because the ball will find you,” Malone said. “That’s just how we play.”

2) “He’s a really good shooter, he can post up guys, he can go by guys, he’s a really talented player,” Jokic said. “We didn’t have a player like that just size-wise (last year). …  You can see he’s attacking the basket. He’s just going to the ball, like he’s bullying people. He’s gonna be really good.”

3) Porter knows his on-court development is a work in progress, which is why he’s unlikely to get the starting small forward job. His defense must improve substantially, and his feel for his new role will take time.",1570333771,f2ov3pe,t3_ddy6du,/r/nba/comments/ddy6du/hes_gonna_be_really_good_nuggets_cant_hide/f2ov3pe/,33,nba,comment

4989,FCBUGA,t2_rr0zs,"I’m on your side in this, there is no doubt that while Melo is an all time great scorer, that’s really where his excellence ends. His career ts is around 54% which is basically league average for the time he played in. Defensively he had a net negative dbpm nearly his entire career, and that is largely confirmed by the eye test as well. He was a solid rebounder, but at the expense of ditching his assignment to snag several of the defensive boards. However, he was an excellent offensive rebounder. I think during his prime, especially in New York he would have excelled if he had a more stable point guard to run the offense. Off the top of my head he played with Felton, Lin and Prigioni, and while all 3 had their moments none could provide the playmaking, shooting ability, and perimeter defense you need paired next to Melo. It seems like most people arguing for Melo only bring up counting stats to support their thesis, 25k club, # of all stars, and ppg. Which all of them are either subjective or do not tell the full story. My case for Paul George is that in nearly every category, excluding scoring, PG is far superior. First, on the defensive end, it all starts with willingness. PG is one of the most willing defenders we have in the league. He creates deflections and steals, and is among the league leaders in both categories year in year out. On this end of the floor he is a sturdy rebounder as well, grabbing 18% of defensive rebounds for his career. George can also guard 1-4, and has done so on several occasions when needed. On the attack, PG is levels above Melo in efficiency, which is the name of the game at this point. He hit a peak this past season in scoring volume, while I doubt he can top this in LA given the multitude of options, I wouldn’t say 25ppg is out of the question this season if healthy. PG also is a steady creator in the offense, though he will never be the primary assist man on any team, he is a willing passer and knows when to look for his shot, or defer to another. Overall, George has the more complete game that is fluid enough to adapt to any situation.",1570335389,f2oz9h9,t1_f2ou0ml,/r/nba/comments/ddxxib/has_paul_george_already_had_a_better_nba_career/f2oz9h9/,-4,nba,comment

4999,duxoy,t2_zjgir,"This is stupid, OP ask a question, ask to be convinced out of his answer to the question (which was not a question because OP post is shit) and then try to bash everyone that tell him otherwise.

So first comparing career when one isn't over is stupid.

then in every stupid question like this one, it depends on what you mean ... 

how do you judge a better career ? cause what i see from here is just you wanting to diss melo with a ""question"" (like you even start with no olympic shit lmao).

so i don't know what make a better career. i'll let you the useless talk about how pg has more x than melo and how melo has more y than PG. from what you wrote stats are so close for the 2 player that given the differences in context it can't means shit. Melo seems to have more individual trophies but PG career isn't over.

Then i saw you talk about playoffs success. Both have none. They went to a conf final, thats all you can say. If you want to compare it you would have to account for context and so i would once again be endless useless talk.

So what can we got from this. nothing for anyone with a brain. Cause they would already know that the question and your way to ask it is stupid. But you could understand that if you ask a question just to say your answer this is what you would get, no what you want and downvotes so you at least have an explanation for that

Now if you really want answers, make an other post, state how you define the criteria for career value and ranking then you'll have a discussion but you only went here in an attempt for validation you clearly don't want to listen to people if they don't say the same as you are ...

5004,King_Of_Pants,t2_7ehjz,"&gt;I literally just chose some of the guards he matched up with the most across possessions

Yeah, and you understand there's a very clear bias here right?

Simmons isn't matching up often against the guards he struggles against. 

When looking at Kemba's most frequent matchups: 

* Rajon Rondo (held to 40%)
* Eric Bledsoe (held to 45%, averaged 56% for the season)
* D'Aaron Fox (held to 32%) 

I guess by your logic we should be putting Kemba on Curry? 

&gt;He hasn't shown that capacity because he hasn't been assigned to Kemba full-time at all, specifically because Sixers teams in the past needed to have Redick guard the small players or he'd get bullied by the bigger ones.

Against a team like Charlotte, this isn't really a concern at all. They run plenty of smaller guards to match Redick onto. 

At 6'4, Redick is right in between Lamb (6'5) and Monk (6'3).",1570246881,f2hqfkn,t1_f2houjt,/r/nba/comments/ddfpbf/how_will_nba_teams_counter_sixers_height/f2hqfkn/,1,nba,comment

&gt; and more importantly it creates political division which is fruitless. People only counter with the Gulen argument if they’re more interested in creating chaos than they are interested in solving issues.

Hahhahah. North Americans are so complacent that they would literally support the reincarnation of Hitler if he said ""Fuck Trump"". Pick your friends wisely because Gulen and Erdogan are two apples from the same tree and a case could be made that Gulen is worse.

However, losing Turner is *not* that bad... I loved the dude but I really did not like watching him shoot unreliable turnaround midrange fadeaway jumpers every game. Plus the addition of Nas Little will take some of Turner's minutes and we will be able to develop that young talent.

Meyers Leonard was not a loss for us at all, either. He only played ~14mpg and contributed 1 three pointer a game. His minutes will be absorbed by Collins and Whiteside, two players who I would far rather want to play intead. 

The relatively long-term members of that core who went to the Conf. Finals were not significant contributors, and I think we actually improved our roster in terms of impactful players from last year to now.

Brogdon will be 27 most of the year going into his 4th season and has been improving every year.

Bledsoe will be 30 most of the year and going into his 11th season and his counting stats have actually dropped off a bit with a very clear prime from around 2014-17.

I also think usuage plays a big role. I don’t have stats to back it up but the games I watched it seemed like bledsoe had the ball in his hands more often which will lead to more assists as well as turn overs.

Where the fuck did I defend Erdogan. Yall have no idea what whataboutism means and it's a favorite of people who just don't want to admit that the choice that they defend is also a shitty one. If there are three people and two of them are shit and they dislike each other, should I support one just because? Nonsense. 

Read the definition of whataboutism.

&gt; discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument

I agree with Kanter that Erdogan is bad, but guess what, I also don't support his choice either. If you think that's whataboutism, I guess you just want a reality where we only have binary choices and thinking outside of those two choices shouldn't be allowed. Americans have already adopted that model, you should instill it in Canada.

The Duerte, Trump, Hitler comparison is also not apt and honestly idiotic. If Duerte or Trump was facing Hitler in an election, that would make sense as a comparison since they are all involved in the same event.

Jaren also was 19 and grew almost 2 inches and added some muscle so that should help with rebounding and foul trouble which are his only major flaws.

5591,deezee72,t2_xx25l,"There's actually a analytics reason why players who shoot significantly above 40% are very rare. 

From a basic maths perspective, if the points per possession on one of your shots is better than the team average, the team should be trying to get you more shots. 

The league-leading Milwaukee Bucks had an offensive rating of 113.5, which translates to 1.135 points per possession. Disregarding fouls and turnovers, this suggests that if you shoot better than ~38% from 3, no matter what team you play on, your team should be trying to find you more 3 point attempts.

As a result, players who shoot above those numbers are generally either catch and shoot specialists (in which case it might be hard for the team to generate more attempts, since it puts a burden on the playmaker), players who played before the analytics movement developed this understanding, or Steph Curry, who shoots well above this mark even when creating his own shot at a high volume as the focal point of an elite offense.",1570160890,f2dprkn,t1_f2ddd4w,/r/nba/comments/dd068d/pippen_on_if_he_thinks_well_ever_see_another/f2dprkn/,3,nba,comment

no, it means height is important. it doesn't mean it's MORE important than skill. nba players are BOTH tall AND skilled.

And outside being maybe the worst team ever at keeping our draft choices a secret, its not like the Sixers telegraph their moves. So why would we have heard about Jimmy to the Heat? 

This is the first I've ever heard someone saying that Jimmy had anything to do with trading for Tobias. Maybe it is the reason, and me missing something is very possible, but I never heard that before. 

I think the Horford move happened once they knew about Jimmy, and because of that JJ was left out.

Before Kemba we were in a position to take on Adams with no outgoing salary.

6092,BlackHatBadger,t2_6j66h,"I did understand you sarcasm. And i disagree with the underlying idea behind said sarcasm, hence my reply. 

Did you just literally define exploitation (WHICH ISN'T SUBJECTIVE. IT'S A WORD WITH A MEANING, LIKE ALL WORDS) then say you disagree with the definition, which you were kind enough to give? Please find the correct word/phrasing for whatever you're thinking because exploitation is taken. Thanks for ending that argument for us. 

It feels to me that you believe that the value added to society by doctor's isn't properly represented in how they're accommodated for the skills they have that add that value? Correct? And that they add arguably the most (I'd say teachers, but that's some chicken and the egg shit with one keeping the other alive to learn from him how to keep him alive), which is why you feel they're ""exploited"" the most?

It's not a scale. You are either exploited under capitalism or exploiting others. That's the economic system. That's how it runs. This is where good vs evil comes in (since the whole thread started over the idea that there are no good billionaires, idk why you'd try to dismiss the topic of the conversation).

If you are exploiting others to pay your bills, I can not, and will not, be able to think of you as good. But I won't think of you as even slightly evil unless you prove otherwise. (Honestly, most people just *are* to me. I know like 5 genuinely good people and like 2 genuinely evil irl.) But it shows such a lack of awareness of the world around you and the struggles the exploited workers, from every sector, face every day if you don't look in the mirror with disgust at putting money in your wallet off the hard work of other people.

Once every person on earth's basic needs are met, we can start having good billionaires. Until then, fuck them all.",1570074511,f28yrtq,t1_f28w1mw,/r/nba/comments/dcczgz/forbes_400_clippers_owner_steve_ballmer_is_the/f28yrtq/,1,nba,comment

Being the jovial big man did not win him a damn thing in over 10 years in the NBA, perhaps it's time he tries to change his approach to basketball?

&gt;You get the sense watching these interviews that he just isnt in the cheery spirits he used to be when he was in Orlando.

His cheery spirits did not win him a damn thing, is he supposed to skip up and down the court with a wide smile all the time?

&gt;Him saying he had to kill his ego to get to where he is now, on top of the fact that he always says he doesnt have many friends in the NBA

Why does he needs friends in the NBA? If they weren't bound together by being in the NBA do you honestly believe he would be friends with other players? Howard has like five bastard kids, he should be busy being a father to them, not looking for friends to go out at night and possibly knock up some more women which means less money for the bastards he already have.   

&gt;that hes trying to play by other people's rules and its ruining the game of basketball for him.

If he has it so bad he can retire or play in China where he can dominate other players with a smile on his face.",1570074803,f28z39g,t3_dckm2c,/r/nba/comments/dckm2c/i_feel_really_bad_for_dwight_howard/f28z39g/,1,nba,comment

6194,mar21182,t2_1tw9bh38,"That's mostly because they just didn't care in the regular season, and they were not concerned about the Clippers at all in that first playoff series. When Golden State wanted to lock you down on defense, they did.

Losing Iguodala and Klay for most of the season is going to mess up everything they do on defense this year. They can't switch everything anymore. They don't have a death lineup. It's going to be a struggle.

I don't know what Klay is going to look like when he comes back this season. I can't exactly just assume he's going to be great like usual. If Klay is close to normal though, I think GS can be decent defensively. I just don't think this roster can be dominant.

Then offensively it's going to be a struggle to put the ball in the basket when Curry is off the floor. Theoretically, DLo helps in that he gives them a primary ball handler and playmaker when Steph sits. They never had that before. However, DLo and pieces isn't going to get you a great offense.

I'm betting you see a lot of Steph playing with bench units this year because apparently you can slot Curry into any lineup and have a top 5 offense. That way, it gives DLo more threats in the floor and balances things out.",1570075084,f28ze98,t1_f28s63b,/r/nba/comments/dchog3/per_ethan_strauss_the_warriors_dont_want_to_trade/f28ze98/,1,nba,comment

6317,captainhukk,t2_lp0bw,"The quant funds that actually make money would take a PHD in physics without a CFA over a PHD in physics with a CFA anyday.  If you don't know that, you're the fool.  Prestigious doesn't mean valuable lol, have fun wiping your ass in 10 years with it as it loses pretty much all its value though, while my CPA generates me hundreds of thousands a year through little effort.

CFA part 1 and 2 is a joke btw lol, I helped my friends study for it and it was laughable how fucking easy it was.  Part 3 involves some math that makes it somewhat harder than the CPA i'll give you that, but it really isn't that hard.

Thinking that CPA's are number janitors is hilarious though.  Its probably as relevant to CPAs as my experience with dumbass CFAs.  Only someone who truly doesn't know what they're talking about thinks that CPA's aren't extremely valuable in the finance world, as well as the business world.  You clearly don't know very many smart CPAs which is fine, because neither do I and thats why I do so well for myself.

By the way i'm also a software engineer and write software that is way harder to make than passing the CFA is, as well as way more valuable.  And thanks to the stupidity of many CPA's its easy as shit to make money handoverfist with creating Accounting software and running my own business using it.  So i'm happy that your experience with CPAs validates my own, as it shows that even though i'm making a lot of money now, I have plenty of room for massive growth :)

6434,captainhukk,t2_lp0bw,"""You are either exploited under capitalism or exploiting others"" that is just not fucking true at all lmao.  I run my own SaaS business with a partner, we both own 50% of our company and have 0 employees.  We provide a service and software that is cheaper than all our competitors, to the point where we've massively expanded the overall market for our product to include those in the low and middle income classes (from which they make money using our product, not losing it).

So please tell me how i'm being exploited, or how i'm exploiting others?  After all, you said its a binary condition of capitalism, with absolutely no middle ground.  So explain to me how that is occuring for my situation?

Also you do realize in my first comment, I literally talked about how I don't think billionaires are evil IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY AMERICANS BASIC NEEDS ARE MET.  If you want to try and extrapolate that to the world, you are missing nuance that has nothing to do with capitalism, and everything to do with corrupt governments (We sent tons of money to Haiti, almost none of it went to the people who we tried to help with it, that isn't capitalism's fault, thats the corrupt governments fault).

I don't think that doctor pay is the problem, I'm actually writing a book on the vast problems in our healthcare system (almost all of which aren't addressed by any plan put out by any candidate including medicare for all), that explains it, and i'm not getting into that argument right now.  The only thing i'll say about it is that our government has kept the supply of doctors low (they capped residency funding at 1996 levels under the 1996 balanced budget act).  They're exploited heavily by the government, patients, health insurance companies, employers, and other doctors.  Its a very complex and nuanced system, and increasing payment to even 10 million a year won't stop the fact that they're being exploited still.


Making a profit off of others hard work isn't inherently evil or wrong, there are certainly many cases where it happens, but the fundamental concept of making a profit off of other peoples hard work doesn't automatically equal exploitation or that you're a bad person, or that you should feel bad about it.",1570076251,f290lu4,t1_f28yrtq,/r/nba/comments/dcczgz/forbes_400_clippers_owner_steve_ballmer_is_the/f290lu4/,1,nba,comment

6527,TheBrazilianKD,t2_zgq24,"A LOT of subjective imagination here but IMO:

* Kobe is the better shooter. I am going to make this argument a lot but if he was raised in this era I think his 3pt shooting would be a lot better. He didn't make it a focus until his Achilles tore, he relied on the midrange 2 his whole career. My basis for this would be his excellent FT% on massive volume.

* My argument at the beginning is Lebron is better around the rim because he's bigger. SUBJECTIVE but I believe Kobe has more creative finishes and is better with his footwork on finishes..how would we ever tell who is more 'skilled'? My guess is Kobe but I see why many go Lebron.

* The most debatable one: IMO Lebron is better at passing but not that much more than Kobe. Again if Kobe grew up in this league I think he would be much better. I think where most argue Lebron excels is making the reads and the cross court passes; but was that kind of play prevalent when Kobe was young? IMO the early 2000s was characterized by clogged lanes, no shooting, and ISO basketball; all that means Kobe never adopted any of this into his playstyle. And sure enough he retained his 'scorer mentality' but we saw so many flashes of cerebral reads and game adjustments.

Again to sum up I give Lebron the slight nod in passing but in every other category I like Kobe better.",1569987776,f25z3dq,t1_f25cvia,/r/nba/comments/dc0cuw/baron_davis_kobe_is_more_skilled_lebron_is_the/f25z3dq/,1,nba,comment

I think losing Lamb and not having a replacement for him hurts more. I think losing Parker, despite limitations last year, hurts some. I even think losing Kaminsky, despite having more limitations, hurts. This is a team that will rely on Rozier, Bridges, Monk, and Batum.. and maybe Zeller if he can last for more than half a season. Doesn't look good to me.

I also think some of the competition around and under them last year got better. Miami looks like a playoff team now. Orlando is rolling it back and they look to be a lock for a lower seed. The Nets look like a solid mid seed instead of a mid-season-maybe. Detroit looks about the same for good or worse. Atlanta, Chicago, and even the Knicks all look better than they did last year and at least one of those teams could push for a bottom seed.

6621,ST012Mi,t2_z4m9hcw,"He's worked on it and refined it over the off-season.  He even got a respectable defender like Danny Green with it.  He's just using this occasionally in order to enter it into the defenders' calculus to have them thinking about one more thing where he'll have a counter to it by not gathering and continuing into a drive.  He shown in pick-up games time and time again that it has it's use.  It's not something that will be as pervasive as the stepback obviously but he's gotten it down to where shooting off one foot like Dirk, KD but just a different iteration is reducing the variability to his shooting movement (one foot needs to be in sync rather than two) which some argue results in a straighter shot.  I don't think it will be as popular for other players to take on like the eurostep, stepback, and side step shots because of difficult of coordination but Harden is always working on something.  The third shot is something CP3 does.  It's working on having a pocketless shot (i.e., no shot pocket) that Donovan Mitchell raved about when talking abotu CP3.  Basically if you don't have just a single pocket that you can shoot from then that makes you even more unpredictable and able to get a shot off without performing all sorts of contingent set-up into a shot to be in rhythm.",1569988329,f25zpqr,t1_f25za9d,/r/nba/comments/dbyewg/brickley_posting_more_of_harden_working_on_his/f25zpqr/,1,nba,comment

6819,babygotdak04,t2_rftxp8r,"It was noteworthy on Mavs Media Day bc when Stein sent out the tweet about the NBA tightening up heights, Dirk tweeted out a joke about JJ.

So media day arrived and it was fresh on the mind of Dallas media. JJ came in at 5-10. Since the Mavs also have the two tallest players on the roster (Boban, Porzingis), the media cared to find out who was really taller.  

Thus, it became more of a story there in Dallas than other places. There had also been great debate about Doncic’s true size, so that’s where the tweet derived from. Townsend was saying that the *old* heights were listed on the roster given to those media people on Media Day, but he got the true height from players/staff when interviewing them. 

Here’s the original:

&gt;On media notes, official team roster, etc, Doncic still will be listed at 6-7. Likewise, even though Porzingis measured at 7-2 and three-quarters he'll be listed at 7-3. Heights will be rounded to the nearest inch.

If you watch their games, I would rather take JJJ, Robinson, Bagley, almost the entire class of PF/centers over Ayton.  If there was one stat I will take a look at, it's the fact that he played over 30 mins last season and averaged fewer than 1 BPG and 1 SPG with limited deflections, on limited defensive effort, on a team that didn't improve at all despite getting him and Booker getting better.  I doubt Ayton ever really gets better, reminds me of Andrew Wiggins his rookie year and a slightly better version of Jahlil Okafor.  Ayton just is better than a lot of people now because of his physical ability, but he doesn't have much upside.

7306,whiskyhighball,t2_3ls80lqa,"NYK fans need an outside scapegoat for their own impotent shittiness and KP is a perfect foil.

Guy gets booed simply for getting drafted and fans are shocked -- SHOCKED! -- when he wants to leave ASAP. The owner bans franchise legends for criticizing him. His GM made him deal with constant trade rumors, and the next GM wouldn't offer him a max extension. His coach tells his best buddy to tell him to ""stop playing like a pussy."" Gets locked out of the practice gym in the cold (which is like an hours drive across the city). His best teammate besides a rapidly depreciating Melo was like...Tim Hardaway Jr.?, losing record season after season, revolving door of coaches and scrub teammates...

The kind of competence like trading your franchise superstar to open cap space for superstars who don't come (and you don't even apparently make an offer for) plus expecting to win a &lt; 14% chance at Zion...it's a franchise run by chickens with their heads cut off.

Even afterwards, The Knicks front office did an excellent job throwing Porzingis under the bus while KP just thanked NY fans and kept his mouth shut.

But, no it's Porzingis's fault for wanting the hell out.

I wish people would stop comparing Porzingis to AD or Kawhi or any of the other stars forcing their way out of teams that were actually doing everything they could possibly do to keep them happy. Plus, AD and Kawhi voluntarily agreed to stay with their previous franchises before changing their minds and forcing their way out, while KP had no choice but to play for the crappy team who drafted him.",1569902799,f231f5b,t3_dbm822,/r/nba/comments/dbm822/who_gets_the_most_boos/f231f5b/,1,nba,comment

Harden and CP3 meshed pretty well. The offense operated at a very high level when both were on the floor together, and when just one was on the floor at a time.

The data can be found on his basketball-reference page just after “advanced” under “shooting.”  B-ball reference doesn’t have data for 0-5 ft or for 3-5ft, but really the 0-3 ft range they provide is the best range for “finishing at the rim.”",1569903285,f231ya1,t1_f2315ih,/r/nba/comments/dbkz2d/highlight_harden_unveils_his_new_onelegged_move/f231ya1/,1,nba,comment

7482,notsellingjeans,t2_sawo4,"I think this is a useful move for Harden specifically in the right corner, or right wing.  Three reasons:

1.  Teams will always force him right from that vantage point, and essentially concede this shot (fadeaway drifting right is unblockable with defender on his left hip).

2.  He doesn't need as much range on this shot as he would at the top of the key, since it's the 22 foot corner three.

3.  If Russell is running the show up top, and Harden can shoot this shot at a ~35% clip or higher, that's a pretty big deal, because it means that he can conserve a ton of energy just standing in the right corner for some possessions while Russell runs the show.

His next stop for his second stint with the Cavs was also a superteam. Kyrie was already a two time All Star and he made the All NBA team in his first season with LeBron. What he did in terms of All NBA and All Star selections *while playing with LeBron* is as significant to the argument than what he did prior. Kevin Love was a 3 time All Star and 2 time All NBA player before joining the Cavs, not to mention a consensus top 3 power forward in the league. People forget his record double double  streak, being the first player to have a 30-30 game in so long etc. That guy was a legitimate star in the league. Add a top 2 player of all time and that is damn well a superteam. Two of the four years those three played together *all three* made the All Star team in the same year. Again, you'd have to have some kind of mental deficiency to think that doesn't constitute a superteam. You don't *need* to have two top five players to have a superteam. The loose definition is usually more along the lines of having three All Star caliber players in the same team ie a Big Three.

His deal is manageable because the King’s star players are on rookie deals rn. They’ll have flexibility when they have to pay Fox and Bagley. 

SF is also a premium position and the King’s had a glaring hole there last season hence why they traded for him. He’s a solid 3rd or 4th option that can hit 3’s, create in late shot clock scenarios when necessary, moves the ball well. He’s also a solid, versatile defender that can switch to multiple positions.

He was a let down in Dallas but he’s just not a number 1 scoring option. Dallas had to pay someone though and struck out on every big free agent that season .

AI was the first I remember bringing a certain black aesthetic to the game with his tats, corn rows, and jewelry, and the NBA heads weren't very happy about this.

They're both pretty average height/weight for their position, not really saying much here.

&gt;shooting

Larry is a member of the 50/40/90 club sharpshooter club, Luka shot below league average in both FTs and 3% - something Bird has never done. In what way is that similar...?

&gt;playmaking

Larry was such a good playmaker/facilitator his first season that he turned the losing record Celtics in deep playoff contenders his rookie season. Luka is a good playmaker, especially for a rookie, but Larry was elite his very first season.

&gt; lack of athleticism

Larry has above-average athleticism, especially for his team. People always assume Larry's not athletic because they compared him to Magic but he had a VERY good rim finishing ability because of agility along with his IQ. He was definitely above average. Luka isn't.

&gt;good handle but not flashy.

The one thing I can agree on. Sure.

People need to chill with the comparisons because Luka is nowhere near rookie Larry Bird in skillset or ability, unless you count being white as a skillset.",1569728498,f1sgdme,t1_f1sdu1y,/r/nba/comments/daixqx/larry_bird_kobe_was_always_my_favorite_since_i/f1sgdme/,1,nba,comment

8010,mcassweed,t2_ewy8t,"&gt;okay not multiple tiers

I really don't see the issue here. I feel like most people here don't actually comprehend just how large the gap is. 

We can safely ignore playmaking, because Harden is definitely in a different league compared to PG in terms of court control. 

If we compare just scoring, Harden averaged 36 ppg at an elite TS 62%. PG averaged 28 ppg at a very good TS 58%. Harden isn't only scoring 8 more points than PG, he is doing it at a better efficiency too. 

Now, if someone goes from scoring 17 points per game to 25 points per game, we would say that player went from a good role player to a potential offensive star (depending on age of course). However, going from 17ppg to 25ppg is something we already see often. On the other hand, going from 28 to 36 is also 8 points, but significantly harder.

8038,jgatch2001,t2_10s9bm,"Overrated: 
Brogdon. I love the guy but people take his 50/40/90 season and assume he’s one of the best shooters in the league. He’s good, but one of the reasons his 3pt% is so high is because he never really took any contested threes. His playmaking is decent, but he has tunnel vision and doesn’t have the dribbling skills to be the main playmaker on the floor. His defense in the playoffs wasn’t as solid as it was on previous seasons, but he was coming off an injury so I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.


He’s still a good shooter and is really great at driving and finishing, but people kind of inflate his skill just because he played okay and made timely shots vs the Raptors. I’m still high on him though and he can still improve on the Pacers


Underrated: 
Ben Simmons honestly. Yes he doesn’t have a jumper but people really discredit how good he is despite his limited offensive game. He’s a great finisher and is always a threat driving to the rim, not to mention his insane passing ability. He’s versatile enough on defense to guard 1-4 as well. He just doesn’t have the perfect team around him to showcase his skills because he‘s best with shooters around him to spread the floor, and that might make people see him as worse than he is.",1569728681,f1sgtaz,t3_daq3eb,/r/nba/comments/daq3eb/what_are_your_most_overrated_and_underrated/f1sgtaz/,3,nba,comment

8077,brdnknrd,t2_2um8rfja,"Good lord, only in r/nba would we have people arguing that players are like slaves because they can’t demand a trade. These people are among the most richly compensated human beings to ever exist in history. And they aren’t compelled to do shit. If they don’t want to play in the NBA, they don’t have to.  They can work regular jobs for regular salaries like everyone else in the world. If they want to play in the NBA, they have to live with the circumstances, which means that in order for the NBA to have some semblance of competition and parity (which frankly, there isn’t much of in the league) is to allow teams to have contracts that can be enforced and allow teams some kind of stability. Every other job/company in the world has a set of operating procedures that employees have to agree to in order to work there. But somehow it’s the athletes that are oppressed for having to do the same thing?

The only 14 year old mentality is the one where you are so star struck by your favorite athletes that you convince yourself that they are being oppressed by “anti-progressives” with a “slave”-like mentality because they believe they should be required to carry out the details of the contract they signed in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars.

8080,danfiction,t2_f26sb,"He didn't play in the NBA, but the tallest basketball player in international play was even taller than this—Suleiman Ali Nashnush, who apparently played for Libya in the 60s at 8'0. According to his (very short and sketchily sourced) Wikipedia article he was actually closer to your exact number, 7'10, by the time he played professionally. 

All that said, there is no footage of Nashnush playing basketball and I can't find a photo of it, either, though I could have sworn I saw one as a kid. And Libya doesn't appear to have qualified for any major tournaments in 1962 (the year he's supposed to have played for their national team) or 1963 (the year of the FIBA championships), although there was at least a national team at that point. So I'm not sure how much basketball he actually played. [Alexander Sizonenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Sizonenko), who played at a high level in the Soviet Union and on their national team in the 80s, was also listed at 7'10-7'11 during his career and is much easier to verify.",1569729007,f1shnvr,t3_dammxb,/r/nba/comments/dammxb/if_the_tallest_male_player_would_deviate_as_many/f1shnvr/,2,nba,comment

8099,Fritodelay24,t2_4ecxprht,"Brogdon’s a good one. Basketball fans are weird. We idolize completely arbitrary statistics like 50-40-90, for example someone like Curry is vastly more efficient than Brogdon despite not really reaching 50% field goal percentage because he takes so many more threes that it lowers his overall fg% but his overall TS% is much higher. 


What Brook Lopez did last year was more impressive than Brogdon. Give me 6 and a half, 3-pointers a game on 36% shooting over 4.3, 3 pointers a game on 42%. Math says Lopez is more valuable as a shooter.

And Yea- Ben Simmons is really underrated. He’s in a weird spot where he’s not really a star- but also overqualified to be a role player- and he has one of the more peculiar playstyles.

I don’t really like his fit with Embiid- although what else is Philly going to do.

I think if you put him next to a team kind-of similar to how the Rockets are constructed but with more transition play- I think he’d be absolutely brilliant.",1569729108,f1shwex,t1_f1sgtaz,/r/nba/comments/daq3eb/what_are_your_most_overrated_and_underrated/f1shwex/,1,nba,comment

8109,Reddits_For_NBA,t2_x9ud1,"The reductionist logic makes no sense in this case. The caveats are already laid out there. Championships alone are meaningless, but individual success combined with championships make perfect sense for comparison. I feel like r/NBA is always on this dick-riding “championship comparisons don’t make sense”. We all know which championships matter and which ones make sense to compare for players. Similarly, context matters, and you and the rest of r/NBA like to ignore it in favor of counting numbers and efficiency stats and advanced metrics that clearly can be corrected for, but ultimately culminate in 0 actual achievement.

It’s like the case of Olympic runners. Have people gotten that much faster in the single generation? That much better nutrition? No, it’s been shown that the vast majority of improvement from the earliest Olympic events is a result of environmental changes — better shoes, less wind, tighter and more aerodynamic clothing, better ground, etc.

Same thing for basketball.

I’m not going to bother responding to the overplayed Shaq bit. No one cares how much Kobe memorabilia you claim to have on the internet. “I’m not racist, my best friends are black” is no more valid in basketball than it is anywhere else.

It’s not even a Kobe vs. Harden thing. Allen Iverson, Dwayne Wade, to the extent you consider TMAC a SG, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Manu Ginobili. You don’t think if any of these guys made it a conscious decision to have a shot chart that looks like it was drawn with a compass wouldn’t be able to produce with that level of efficiency?

I think a lot of superstars eventually just want second superstars, the bucks have done an amazing job at fielding a team around Giannis without a second one, but if they get bounced again because the role players impact doesn't translate in the playoffs, I wouldn't be surprised if history repeated itself",1569730413,f1sl5vm,t1_f1rtmpl,/r/nba/comments/daocvk/stephen_a_smith_2005_if_kevin_garnett_was_guilty/f1sl5vm/,1,nba,comment

Defensively brown is certainly better, but honestly I think he’s pretty overrated on that end. He looks like he should be elite, and his on-ball defense is really strong, so this leads people to believe he’s a little better than he is. His team defense though leaves a lot to be desired.

But, I'd imagine that some teams basically refuse to trade guys who want out and force the player to go the extreme route - and there's definitely some team that did things that way so the hate would be on the player rather than them.

All the stuff that happens behind closed doors is why it's so hard to evaluate this stuff. We don't know who's actually being fair, who's not, and who's lying about what's going on.

8355,thisishorsepoop,t2_a3oqz,"&gt;Eric Bledsoe is 29. This is his prime. If he’s not good enough now, he won’t be in two years. Bledsoe has got to show something this upcoming year in the playoffs.

Yeah it's a problem if he shits the bed in the playoffs again no doubt about it. However it's not like being 29 means the mental side of your game starts declining. He's not a great shooter by any stretch but he isn't 17% from 3 bad either. If he even just shot closer to his regular season 33% instead of 17% it would have been a different series vs. TOR. In terms of defense, finishing at the rim, and taking care of the ball he had the best year of his career and I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that he can't expand on that or get over his playoff yips.

&gt;Brook Lopez is 31. Same goes for him. He’s not gonna get any better these next two years. 

Why does Lopez need to get better? He's already an amazing fit with Giannis and I don't really see why his game would decline significantly if at all from now until when he's 33. Trailing in transition and parking behind the 3-point line is most of his offense, and on defense he mostly just plays drop coverage. To say his game isn't dependent on athleticism is an understatement. 

&gt;George hill is 33. Hill is already on the decline but is still a very valuable role player. But in two years? He’s likely not gonna be of much help. 

The Hill contract makes me uneasy a couple years down the road I agree, but I seriously doubt it'd be untradeable and become the deciding factor in whether we bring someone else in or not. Plus I do really like him as a Bledsoe insurance policy.

&gt;Ersan Ilyasova is 32. He’s a role player now and in two years likely won’t be getting any meaningful minutes. 

He's only guaranteed for this upcoming season, not really important. Also he's probably 35 lol

&gt;I know a lot of people and almost all bucks fans take any post about why Giannis would leave as hate but I don’t get how u couldn’t be concerned.

We're not concerned because Giannis is two years from free agency and there really isn't any point in bring concerned about it. If he leaves then he leaves. We've put a really good team around him and it has a great chance to make that Finals appearance that you feel is a necessary condition for him staying, so we just wanna enjoy it. 

&gt;It’s a real tough spot for the bucks to be in but they did contribute to this somewhat by choosing not to keep brogdon. 

I ultimately wish we kept Brogdon, but you know those cap issues with Middleton and Giannis on a supermax? Not overpaying a guy who wanted a bigger role elsewhere, avoiding the repeater tax, and getting picks back is a fine way of mitigating whatever damage might come about from letting him go - which I really don't think will be as much as people make it sound sometimes.

&gt;Basically my opinion on this is if the bucks don’t make a finals appearance in these next two years they got no shot to keep giannis cause their will be no upside for him to stay.

Besides the whole supermax thing where he'd get the biggest contract any player has ever signed. 

Honestly if we're following your logic to it's conclusion, not even winning a Finals would keep him here and we might as well just trade him now.",1569731186,f1sn2bb,t3_daq1zk,/r/nba/comments/daq1zk/the_main_reason_i_see_giannis_leaving/f1sn2bb/,2,nba,comment

However, given that this hypothetical player would make the current ruleset of basketball utterly outdated, my guess is that they'd let him run rampant for a single season before doing some serious overhauls to maintain the competitive aspect of the game (otherwise the finals devolves into ""who can convince this player to play for them in FA?""). Not sure exactly what they could do, but they'd almost certainly do something to at least try to contain him while still keeping the appeal of his otherworldly athleticism.

8431,LLCoolJRSmith,t2_3x92y3fl,"Thing is, all of that stuff is ""source close to the Knicks"" or ""sources say"" or ""anonymous source close to Anthony."" I'm sorry, but look at how many times players come out and refute storylines. For example, Jeremy Lin once said on a podcast (maybe Zach Lowe? I don't remember. Sorry, but no source on me lol) that Stephen A. was reporting how Lin signed with Brooklyn in 2016. And Lin said he was watching that and thought to himself ""I never even saw this offer."" So stuff like all the media gossip? It's all with a grain of salt for me. 

And also when it comes to ""why does watching the team matter?"" Well, the coverage of that team was insane thanks to Linsanity. MSG Pregame shows were like 2 hours long covering everything that the team was doing. TMZ followed the Knicks around a lot during their team dinners. Seemed like they all were young and having a good time. Was Melo out here plotting that whole time like boy if this dude Lin doesn't get me the ball lmao. And now that Carmelo said on First Take that he admittedly was immature when he was younger, it just drives the debate even more. 

So that's really it. Fwiw, it's always Melo stan v. Lin stan. I got love for both of them. I wish Lin never tore his meniscus. I also wish Melo's tenure worked out better here in NY.

If there is ice cream, frozen yogurt, or lemonade in your smoothie, you can pick a different, healthier option.

The specific smoothie you listed is made with lemonade (mostly sugar), lime sherbet (mostly sugar), and frozen yogurt (mostly sugar). Considering the ingredients, its one of the least smoothie-like and most unhealthy options on the menu. It's basically a fruity milkshake.

Obviously it's not something you should do every day, but there is nothing unhealthy about drinking a smoothie if you are aware of these things, make the smart choice, and avoid unnecessary sugar in your other meals. If you made a smoothie at home with fresh fruit and milk, it would have a very similar nutritional profile to a lot of the options.

* Oladipo will likely miss a large chunk of the beginning of the season. Brogdon also has health concerns dating back to college and he has missed 52 regular season games over the last two seasons.
* Sabonis will be the starting 4, but he is not fit to guard most 4s. The defensive drop-off from Young to Sabonis is severe.

8810,Redpin,t2_356rk,"Couple things, 1: another team can only get 3 years guaranteed from another team, but 5 from the Raps.  Meaning if he signs an offer sheet, the Raps get a shorter contract than they might want.

https://ca.nba.com/news/why-hasnt-pascal-siakam-signed-an-extension-with-the-toronto-raptors-yet/12kdi9wau08zu1w7xqb37s96eu

&gt;The Jazz found themselves in a similar situation with Hayward as the Raptors do with Siakam, and they chose to let Hayward play out his contract and test free agency instead of signing him to a five-year extension. That decision led him to an offer sheet with the Charlotte Hornets in the summer of 2014, which the Jazz matched, but it paved the way for Hayward to test free agency again - this time as an unrestricted free agent - three years later.

&gt;As a result, Hayward left the Jazz for the Boston Celtics just when the franchise appeared to be turning a corner.

&gt;The Jazz rebounded in a way nobody could have foreseen - they were fortunate to draft Donovan Mitchell with the 13th pick in the same summer Hayward left - but it's impossible to predict the Raptors having the same fortune if Siakam were to follow in Hayward's footsteps. In which case, the Raptors run the risk of seeing Siakam walk as he's entering the prime of his career by not getting a deal done now.

#2, if they wait, and Pascal makes an all-NBA team, suddenly, Siakam becomes more expensive.

&gt; ""[Siakam is] eligible for a baseline 25 percent of the 2020-21 salary cap in Year 1 salary, which projects to pay him $168.2 million over five years.""

&gt; ""If he makes an All-NBA team this year, wins MVP or Defensive Player of the Year, then he's eligible for up to 30 percent of the cap, which would pay him $201.8 million on a five-year deal. He can negotiate that raise up to 30 percent in the extension, as Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray have already done with their respective teams this offseason.""

tl;dr

The Raps can max Siakam for $168.2 / 5 Years if they sign him before the season.

If Siakam signs an offer sheet next year, it will be a 3 year + player option, meaning the Raps lose 2 contract years.

If Siakam makes an all-NBA team, the max will cost the Raps $201.8 / 5 Years.",1569643934,f1ofr0n,t1_f1mf65t,/r/nba/comments/da00nf/lewenberg_the_raptors_have_engaged_in_preliminary/f1ofr0n/,1,nba,comment

8955,TheMentatBashar,t2_69jf5,"Pull the trigger on the Amare Stoudemire trade from 2009. The deal was reportedly Wally Sczerbiak, JJ Hickson and a first round pick for prime Amare to pair with LeBron in 2009. Apparently the Cavs didn't make the deal because they didn't want to mess with the team's chemistry.

To be fair, that team overachieved to the tune of a 66-16 record, and a 39-2 record at home. None of that really matters though when we couldn't get out of the East Finals. If we make that deal, we could have rolled out Mo Williams-Delonte West-LeBron-Amare- Big Z. I think it would have hurt our depth a little, but we could have maybe staggered LeBron and Amare a bit to have bench lineups around Amare during LeBron's rest times. 

Overall it just goes back to the old Bill Simmons adage of ""You always turn four quarters into a dollar if you can"" Amare was a legit star at this point, and trading for him could have been the difference in not only the 2009 East Finals, but the 2009 NBA Finals, and LeBron's free agency.",1569644776,f1ogkkz,t3_da9u5r,/r/nba/comments/da9u5r/you_have_an_nba_time_machine_but_you_can_only_go/f1ogkkz/,1,nba,comment

But yeah, damn it’s crazy to think how those two plays might’ve changed overall basketball history. If ‘Melo carries that team to an unexpected title over the Magic, he definitely would be on a team somewhere right now and wouldn’t be memed as much. Billups’ legacy is also much more decorated as there is a legitimate second great chapter to his career after the dominant Pistons teams.

On the flip side, I think there would be a much larger group of people who would be saying that Kobe was just a scorer who couldn’t win it all without Shaq. Obviously maybe they still win it the next year, but I doubt it.

Not only that, he’s European and openly fond of his African heritage. He can single handedly open and secure more markets in two different continents. Guys like Harden, LeBron, and Curry already have secure fanbases and markets, so the NBA needs to look towards their TAM (total available markets) if it wants to grow.

9185,ohgosh_thejosh,t2_hcjip,"&gt; Like those numbers aren't really better than Giannis's regular season numbers are they?

1. Playoffs are weighted more heavily because you’re constantly playing the best teams. You don’t get to put up an easy 39 points on the suns on 70% shooting. Kawhi did this against the fucking 76ers, a team with the best defensive lineup in the league by a mile (their starting lineups DRTG in the playoffs was 90. NINETY.)

Interesting how Giannis killed it in the RS and then his efficiency dropped in the playoffs. Because he was constantly facing elite teams. 

&gt; Everyone in that top tier has bonkers stats. Kawhi's don't really stand out compared to other great playoff runs.

Look up how many guys have ever put up the stats Kawhi did during this playoff run. Just the points and efficiency, we’ll ignore his D and clutch shooting. 

Hint: it’s only ever been done 8 times. If you count only those who even made it out of the 1st round, it’s 4 times. Once by KD, once by Kareem, twice by LeBron. Kawhi did this on a bum leg and won the chip.

Nobody said anything and neither did Tiger, and the other guys sort of looked at one another.

Finally one of the SEALs said, ""Separate checks, please.""

The waitress walked away.

""We are all baffled,"" says one SEAL, a veteran of numerous combat deployments. ""We are sitting there with Tiger f---ing Woods, who probably makes more than all of us combined in a day.

Parker was in his second year and Ginobili was in his first.  Should go without saying that a 37 year old David Robinson was beyond washed at that point.  The view at the time was 100% that it was as close to a one man team as you could get.  Duncan absolutely carried that team to a chip.  

&gt; Kobe's second best was Lamar Odom

Odom was a better player than SJax and Bowen, tbh.  

FWIW I do think Duncan's 03 teammates were better than Kobe's 06 guys, but at the same time given how good Duncan was that season I also think he gets them into the playoffs if you swap the two.  Not a chip, necessarily, but playoffs sure.

9371,pen__pen,t2_14cedi,"Duncan and Hakeem's career numbers are close.

&gt;they had better prime years, playoffs, and career statistics than Duncan and it's not even close.

okay lets compare:

Hakeem 92-96:

23.8 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 3.0 apg, 5.0 stl/blk on 564 TS%.

25.6 PER, .196 WS/48, 60.4 WS, 6.2 BPM, 30.6 VORP

2 titles, 2 FMVP, 39 playoff wins

MVP, 2x DPOY, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team, All-NBA Third Team, 2x All-NBA First Team Defense, All-NBA Second Team Defense

Duncan 02-06:

22.1 ppg, 12.1 rpg, 3.4 apg, 3.3 stl/blk on 550 TS%

26.2 PER, .238 WS/48, 69.4 WS, 6.7 BPM, 30.9 VORP

2 titles, 2 FMVP (he already has one of each in 99), 49 playoff wins

2 MVP, 5x All-Star, 4x All-NBA First Team, All-NBA Second Team, 3x All-NBA First Team Defense, 2x All-NBA Second Team Defense

so basically a wash with the slight edge on Tim Duncan

&gt;If you put either of them in Duncan’s position in San Antonio the teams would be better because of it.

there's no way you can possibly know this. The entire Spurs organisation was built around Duncan's talent and leadership.

Also I simply cannot entertain the thought that Durant is better than Duncan. Maybe a better scorer that's it.",1569557686,f1lkv0i,t1_f1lgyz1,/r/nba/comments/d9u3pn/according_to_bleacher_report_steph_curry_and_tim/f1lkv0i/,1,nba,comment

You’re also ignoring context. Most of Kareem’s prime was during the worst decade in modern NBA history and he was the best player on his six title winning teams like three times maximum.

9448,confusedbartender,t2_oj334,"Well it’s like this. You are right in the sense that a humans potential ceiling (in all facets) is determined at birth. But how do you determine determination it self. Is it possible that major advancements in science never happened because some genius fried his brain on some addiction somewhere? Is it possible that some motivated and determined reasonably intelligent person out there dedicated their entire life in quest of some medical discovery (passion pursuit) and succeeded? 

In the examples you gave I can say that I agree and disagree. I do find high intelligence and natural rhythm more impressive but I don’t always view the individuals that possess those traits as impressive. If they use those natural talents and expand on them and the result is amazing then yes I can be impressed by both their “gift” and effort, but if they coast by then what am I impressed by? Natural selection at work?

I suppose in the end, if I assessed accomplishments and the individuals behind them with the same approach that you use, there would be no reason for me not to support something like eugenics. Also if all it takes is being “less than ideal” for you to cease pursuit of self betterment, then you are essentially against self improvement of any form. I don’t know what “ideal” is in your opinion, but to me no one is ideal. And we are not discussing how ideal they are to me, it is whether they feel ideal about themselves. So even someone like the girl from Wolf of Wall Street (the blonde wife) is not ideal because even though I see zero flaws on her, (physically I mean) I am sure that she probably hates something about herself like a triangular toenail or some shit.  No one is ideal, using it as an excuse against self improvement is like a never ending cycle of complacency.",1569558182,f1lldoc,t1_f1lhr1t,/r/nba/comments/d9fh63/bill_russell_you_know_wilt_im_the_only_guy_on/f1lldoc/,1,nba,comment

9481,Vordeo,t2_oexqt,"&gt; Put simply, at what point in time during their careers did anybody say Tim Duncan was the best player in the world? 

99-05 he had a damn good argument.  It was him and Shaq at 1a and 1b pretty much.  Three chips, three finals MVPs, and didn't really have a great supporting cast for a fair chunk of that time, as Robinson was past his prime and Parker / Ginobili joined midway.  

&gt; Kobe was considered the best player in the world throughout both of their careers 

LOL Kobe wasn't even considered the best player on his team til Shaq left.  *You* might think he was considered the best player in the world 'throughout both of their careers' but most people did not.  There were maybe a couple years where he was the consensus best, but he sure as hell wasn't considered the best when he was missing the payoffs and getting knocked out in the first round.  

If we're talking who were considered best, it'd probably be something like 98-2006: Shaq or Duncan, 2007-08: Kobe, 2009-?: Lebron.  That's a rough draft, and the years are probably debatable, but point is Kobe realistically had a short period where he was considered the best player in the world.",1569558379,f1llksk,t1_f1ldf7v,/r/nba/comments/d9u3pn/according_to_bleacher_report_steph_curry_and_tim/f1llksk/,1,nba,comment

9503,ClozeQueue,t2_o3nia6m,"Yeah the one I’m talking about is the one where Embiid put up 40/15 and won the game. That’s the purpose of that whole basketball thing. We lost Redick but picked up Horford who can hit and provides excellent defense. We also picked up Jrich who can hit and provides excellent defense. JJ is a big loss but he was a major defensive hole. Also you’re very much exaggerating Giannis’ “domination” of Embiid and Horford. You’re acting as though all of his points came while they were his primary defenders, which is simply false. Regardless, Giannis can score as much as he wants, and dominate everybody, you lost that game. Our team has gotten better, yours hasn’t. Giannis dominating won’t singlehandedly win a series, in fact he showed last year that he can be gameplanned for when the Raptors beat you in 4 straight after we took them to 7. There are a lot of great arguments for the Bucks, these are the two best teams in the east, yours just isn’t one of them.",1569469261,f1gkf5j,t1_f1gjv3l,/r/nba/comments/d9cnnt/philly_vs_milwaukee_who_you_guys_got_in_a_7_game/f1gkf5j/,1,nba,comment

Of course, I’m also not making up takes out of thin air about how good our defence on Embiid is like people are about Embiid/Horford on Giannis. Unfortunately it takes more than one player to win games, which is why Giannis put up 52/16/7 and still lost to Embiid’s 40/15, and you just lost your best shooter and second best performer against us.

I’m not arguing, in this instance, that we’ll win the series off the back of Giannis’ domination. I do think we’ll win the series but I laid out my reasoning elsewhere. I’m arguing that the idea that Philly is somehow a great defensive matchup for Giannis when nobody on that team has ever stopped him in the regular season or playoffs is nonsense.

And “showing he can be gameplanned for” means next to nothing when a different team (featuring Horford on Giannis, no less) used that same game plan the series prior and got wrecked.

9596,--101--,t2_4236xyr8,"&gt;Why isn't Charlotte? Why isn't New Orleans? Why isn't Phoenix?



Lol eew

&gt;

Don't even compare Atlanta and Orlando, with these other cities. 

&gt;

Charlotte, New Orleans and Phoenix are bad destinations, and also been a bad team. 

&gt;

But Orlando, Atlanta etc are great destinations, but just not good enough of a team to attract any big fish. They are always in that ""not completely garbage to get a Top 3 pick and not good enough to make the playoffs either"" category. So, basically stuck in the middle. 

&gt;

New York too. Even though they did get some lottery picks, they just never grabbed anyone that could make a difference. They had a chance this year, at Zion, but the basketball Gods just laughed a them once again. 

&gt;

 Why does New York of all places can't get a big free agent? They are the richest franchise in the league, and it's also fuckin New York.. the Madison Square Garden... and all that epic shit. So why not?

&gt;

How does the Brooklyn Nets grab Kyrie and KD, instead of the New York Knicks? 

&gt;

Great destination just doesn't cut it always. There's many more factors that effects free agent decisions, especially for a superstar free agent.",1569469687,f1gkzjc,t1_f1gfvkj,/r/nba/comments/d9dm2z/why_doesnt_atlanta_ever_seem_to_be_a_top_free/f1gkzjc/,1,nba,comment

9726,FKJVMMP,t2_wqcew,"Being great defensively isn’t the same thing as being a great matchup against Giannis specifically. He was constantly 1v1 against Embiid, you yourself said as much, that was supposed to be the gameplan yeah? It’s not like the Celtics had Horford surrounded by poor defenders, they’re a very good defensive outfit too and Giannis still torched their wall in the playoffs. I fully understand basketball isn’t a 1v1 game, but I also understand that none of the players on your team have had any level of success as a primary matchup against Giannis and your team as a whole hasn’t been able to effectively contain our offence at any point.

Your logic is essentially “we have a bunch of good defenders, therefore this is a favourable matchup”, but you should know that’s not how it works. Last year’s playoffs were a great example in fact. Our guard rotation was much better defensively than yours, mostly because we didn’t have a Redick-level defensive disaster, but the Raptors’ guards couldn’t do anything against you guys while they torched us all series. As bad as Bledsoe choked offensively, he was still playing solid D. Didn’t matter though, because our matchups and defensive schemes simply weren’t as effective as yours. The same applies here, there’s nothing that should reasonably lead somebody to believe this is a favourable defensive matchup for Philly because both the individual players and the team/coaching as a whole has never been effective.",1569470525,f1gm2xn,t1_f1gliyl,/r/nba/comments/d9cnnt/philly_vs_milwaukee_who_you_guys_got_in_a_7_game/f1gm2xn/,1,nba,comment

One thing I've thought about a lot with podcasts is the low cost to produce them. I know the Ringer uses producers on each podcast but even that isn't required if the host is willing to do some of the work. Once the podcast is done you pay almost nothing since you don't have to host the podcast on your own servers, you upload it to someone else's. 

So I feel like the Ringer podcast system is operating on a huge profit, while the website itself(the original business of the company) probably makes far less than $150k per employee.",1569471071,f1gmrid,t1_f1glyky,/r/nba/comments/d9e4ki/niemanlab_the_ringers_podcast_ad_sales_topped_15/f1gmrid/,1,nba,comment

9835,ClozeQueue,t2_o3nia6m,"Individual performance is a poor metric when everything about that individuals circumstances has changed. Additionally Horford will now be in at PF rather than Tobi which is a massive upgrade defensively. Both he and Embiid are excellent defenders with Embiid being at a DPOY level with good mobility and great interior protection. Giannis hasn’t had to go against the two of them on the same team, and he hasn’t seen something similar with any kind of consistency. Your issue is that you’re looking at individuals out of context and then choosing to ignore the makeup of our team and the situations of these players changing. You can’t talk defense without noting that our team has gotten SUBSTANTIALLY better defensively, yet you’ve exclusively talked about losing JJ in our offense. Horford and Jrich make up for the JJ loss offensively, they just provide scoring in different ways. Shockingly, now that our team has different players, we will play differently. You can’t just ignore context and talk about individual matchups as though it all exists in a vacuum.
