LeBron is such an idiot for using the words misinformed and “not educated”. He obviously meant morey was short sighted for tweeting something so politically charged without thinking about the ramifications. Do y’all SERIOUSLY think Lebron of all people thinks supporting HK is “misinformed”? Come on.,rockets

"Great post. I don't think Redditors realize how much the general public there support the government. Redditors want to think that the Chinese people are ""oppressed"" and ""brainwashed"" similar to North Korea but that's really not the case. Many of China's elite are educated in the West. Chinese companies also LOVES to hire people with a degree from American universities and/or with experience working for American companies. Those who have studied abroad also enjoy a level of prestige socially. For all its faults, the government has done an extraordinary job of rebuilding China and lifting people out of poverty. As long as the government there continues to make the lives of the average people better, the general public will continue to support the government and overlook its faults.

As the link you posted stated, it's not ""brainwashing"" per say. The current system of government in China is operating as how all imperial dynasties have operated for thousands of years.  As long as the good time continues, it will enjoy the people's support. As soon as the good time ends, the people who revolt and replace it with another autocracy that will promise a return of the good times. This is how the ""mandate of heaven"" work there throughout its entire history.

Chinese culture and society and does not have the foundation of freedom and ""people power"" our society in the West has. It's the opposite, actually (see Confusionism). People there don't share the same passion for ""people power"" people here has because there's no Cultural or historical foundation for it. To quote a popular saying there, ""nothing matters if I don't have rice on my bowl.""

The foundation for ""people power"" in Western society started in Athens, Greece and really cemented itself with the signing of the Magna Carta in the 1200s culminating and growing to the American Revolution and the society we have now. This historical and cultural foundation is why Democracies work so well in Western societies but fails in many other places (Middle East, Africa, ect).",rockets

I doubt average Chinese fans are brainwashed enough to just 'turn off' their allegiance to the Rockets.

They'll be quiet about it (at first), but they will still want to see their favorite team, especially if it is doing well.

I don't think the Chinese government thought the ramifications through appropriately... In time, they will be forced to let the Rockets broadcasts back or they may be risking a needlessly unhappy  population... No government wants to govern a bunch of pissed off people.

I mean...the only way a company can operate within the law and cultural norms of other countries is if its employees abide by said laws and cultural norms.

"What I see is three countries that do not want to be ruled by China and China suppressing any form of discussion about their form of government. It doesn't matter if Chinese people think that these places ""belong"" to them when the people actually living there think otherwise.

This is how most countries gain independence. They are ruled by some form of government that do not represent the interests of the people living there. Once the critical mass of people revolt / protest, it is up to the colonizing country to seriously consider freeing those people. The holding onto these countries with zero tolerance for discussion is just a sign that Chinese leadership is interested in parading their control rather than actually thinking about the interests of the people they are ""governing"".

The false equivalence of this colonialism-style defense of a conquered territory with other country's ""political/cultural taboo"" is most infuriating. China doesn't have some natural right to rule over the people living in the places known as Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan, just like the British didn't have a natural right to rule over India, Australia and all their colonies. In contrast, humans do have a natural right to be treated equally, which is why the standard defense I have heard (aka the Donald Sterling argument) is a ridiculous false equivalence.",rockets

Piss off with your equivocating - and by the way, your statement would likely still be protected under the First Amendment.

But LeBron has really cemented his legacy as a master on the court and a fool off it.  ""I am taking my talents to South Beach"" was Einsteinian compared to what he said yesterday.

How dare Daryl inconvenience him this way to say what he said why you were on your ""arduous"" road trip.  Didn't he know you were late for your massage appointment and could not be bothered with question about human dignity and something not related to your own narcissistic self-interest. 

That is what it comes down to by the way,  LeBron is so self-consumed and so self-absorbed, that anything outside of his narcissistic existence, even internment camps and live organ harvesting, is a trifle and a nuisance and how dare Morey convey this decency and commonly held view while King James had his kingly duties to attend to.",rockets

"Fine deflection there, mate. The more things change, [the more they stay the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes).

Here's a relevant passage from Orwell:

&gt; An illusion can become a half-truth, a mask can alter the expression of a face. **The familiar arguments to the effect that democracy is “just the same as” or “just as bad as” totalitarianism never take account of this fact. All such arguments boil down to saying that half a loaf is the same as no bread.** In England [and America] such concepts as justice, liberty and objective truth are still believed in. They may be illusions, but they are very powerful illusions. The belief in them influences conduct, national life is different because of them. In proof of which, look about you. Where are the rubber truncheons, where is the castor oil? The sword is still in the scabbard, and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond a certain point. The English [and American] electoral system, for instance, is an all-but open fraud. In a dozen obvious ways it is gerrymandered in the interest of the moneyed class. But until some deep change has occurred in the public mind, it cannot become completely corrupt. You do not arrive at the polling booth to find men with revolvers telling you which way to vote, nor are the votes miscounted, nor is there any direct bribery.

For all of America's many faults, it is still a free country. For all of America's many faults, Americans submit secret ballots into boxes that aren't stuffed. For all of America's many faults, Americans can stand and shout for what they believe in without fear of getting teargassed only because they don't like the government, and read what they want on paper and online. America may conduct military operations foolishly and cruelly, but Americans can at least say those operations are foolish and cruel, and they can eventually change and stop them. None of that is true for the People's Republic of China. 

America is not a perfect country. It's not even a good country. But just as half a loaf of bread is not the same as no bread, the flaws of America do not make it comparable to the concentration-camp-operating, organ-harvesting, Hong-Kong-democracy-suffocating brutal dictatorship that is China.",rockets

You need some economic lessons. HK is rich on paper yes, but majority of the wealth lies in the real estate monopoly. Average citizens pay millions to live in a 14 m^2 house.

Fun fact, Yuan dynasty was really just a khanate of the Mongol empire. Other khans called Kublai the Great Khan, but he had no real power in governing the other khanates.",rockets

"Sure thing. In 1989 the west started a conspiracy to topple all socialist governments. They already collapsed the Soviet Union, Balkans, and Eastern Europe. China was showing economic progress at that time. The students at Tiananmen are just like HK today, peaceful protests turned violent. They lynched soldiers and burned down armored trucks. Deng quickly suppressed the movement because it got violent. 30 years later, China became the world’s second largest economy and controls the US market completely. Trust me, we Chinese used to hate the CCP for doing that too. After Tiananmen a lot of people immigrated. However, nowadays our country has become so powerful we began to understand what our government did was for the greater good in the long term. Suppression of protesters is common all over the world, just look at the yellow vests in France. US did the same with LA riots and Ferguson. It’s just a way of life.",rockets

US’s economy is controlled by China. Owes China trillions of dollars in debt. US can’t even beat China in Korea with UN’s help back in 50s, that was the age when Chinese were starving, do you think they can beat modern PLA? Go to China and see for yourself, its infrastructure is 100 times better and more modern than declining US cities like NY, LA, Seattle. Chinese people are proud of how our country has progressed in such a short time. The main reason for the HK riots is that they’re butthurt that mainland China is taking over and they became the financial hub of Asia to nothing more than a tourist attractions.

 As far as your attempt to whatabout Ferguson or LA, the obvious difference is that nobody was run over by a tank or disappeared.  Our cops stood trial, it was fucked up, and people protested. They weren’t arrested for protesting, they were arrested for arson, beatings and looting. All of them were a matter of public record and all those people got a trial if they wanted one. Can you say the same about the CCP?  The economic improvement you keep trying to tout is also nothing to brag about. You’re elite class has become extremely wealthy on the sweat of the poor. It’s not economic ingenuity to pay workers as little as possible, it’s a lack of morals and ethics. Yeah, your economy has taken off, but not in a way that’s humane or decent.

Even for the famous ""tankman"" picture, the tanks stopped and moved away. 

Chinese mainland people had the exact same thoughts years ago. Trust me, we know our country way better than you.

And even though them not throwing Morey under a bus wouldn't change the HK situation, it definitelly shows they value their bags over someone's right to show support for a just cause.

I'm not trying nor willing to crash with you here, I'm just stating that I feel disapointed by both Harden and LeBron on their positions in this.

i think a bigger question is how will the rockets be treated? will the china stuff effect the way they are officiated, or treated around the NBA and media?

game wise the biggest question is on defense, will they be able to be good enough defensively that they will be able to hang with clippers. or maybe if their offense can be good enough that it doesn't matter.

or maybe tactics they might use when harden and westbrook are on the floor together. they have already shown some glimpses of things they might be doing together.",rockets
"Yes, I would go with A as well. It doesn’t mean he’s a bad coach it’s just that he’s not willing to change things. The same can be said for Budenholzer for the Bucks.

"If Steph Curry wants to get a 3 off Steph Curry is going to get a 3 off. You're kidding yourself thinking otherwise. 

Besides, it was a 2 point game so if you chase him hard off the line you're going to give him a wide open look from closer distance if you don't get baited in to a foul for closing space so quick.

Nene got a hand up and gave a good challenge on the shot without fouling. Not anything else you can ask of a defender in that situation.

If Curry misses that shot and we win I guarantee you you're not saying Mike messed up.

Also, it was a 30 second game so should we not have had a center on the floor to try and secure a rebound? If we're small and can't get a board and lose are you not here killing Mike for not having a big man out there?",rockets
"Exactly, everyone says fuck China but when anyone mentions Israel you get downvoted",rockets

"Unlike the average 'know-it-all' that will check in with their valuable opinions on MDA's coaching abilities, I'm going to admit that I don't have enough information to make an educated statement on this.

I know for a fact that MDA is capable of making adjustments *in general*, as his teams in Houston look nothing like the teams he had in Phoenix... particularly in terms of pace.

As for in-game adjustments, I don't have access to what he tells the players... For all I know, he is trying to make adjustments but his team just can't or doesn't do them successfully.

What I do know for sure is that if something has been incredibly successful for a long time, that choosing the most critical moment of the season to ignore it and do something else seems like a pretty strange choice. If it works, things look great, but if it doesn't work either, then the second-guessing one's proven philosophy looks way waaayyy worse than the alternative.

Losing to all-time greats like the Spurs in the early '00s and the Warriors over the past couple years is nothing to be ridiculed for... Especially when luck and ""interesting officiating"" have played such active roles.",rockets

"Compare what LeBron, the social justice “leader” says to what Harden, who rarely ever makes social commentary, said: 
“We all have freedom of speech, that is the world we live in,” said Harden, according to Reuters. “Everyone should (say) how they feel and their thought process, be able to speak it. Obviously some people are going to feel some type of ways, others are going to agree. That is just the world we live in. I am here for Adam Silver.”
How did Harden make a better statement than LeBron James?",rockets

"""I believe he \[actually *has* a pair of testicles and thusly chose to stand against censorship and communist rule over millions of people that want democracy\] and he spoke.""",rockets
"This situation IS complicated with lots of cultural and historical ramifications. It's not as easy as ""good vs evil."" Calling everyone who recognizes it a ""wumao"" and ""brainwashed"" is just ignorant.

I think part of the problem are the incredibly divergent viewpoints, how we in the West can look at Hong Kong, Tibet, Taiwan etc. as somehow ""apart"" from China, while everyone in China view these places as an integral and inseparable part of the Chinese identity. Call it brainwashing or whatever, but as strongly as we believe that every citizen should have a political voice, they believe that these places are an inseparable part of China, not necessarily the political identity but the cultural identity.

Just a quick explainer of how Chinese people view these places:

* Hong Kong - stolen via a war of aggression and unfair treaties.
* Taiwan - it would have been united with China except US chose to support the Kuomintang as their puppet in a world-wide ideological conflict against the USSR.
* Tibet - Conquered and absorbed as part of China since dynastic times. 800 years to be exact. Tibet has been part of Chinese history longer then the US has been a country. Tibet did gain defacto independence from 1912 to 1951. However, in the opinion of the Chinese, this condition does not represent Tibet's independence as many other parts of China also enjoyed de facto independence when the Chinese nation was torn by warlordism, Japanese invasion, and civil war after the fall of Qing Dynasty. It is during this time that the Dali Lama tried to establish an independent theocracy.

External influence may have some effect, but barring some global catastrophe I personally feel a move away from authoritarianism can only spring from within. Honestly how China is ruled has not changed for couple thousand years, with strong reliance on ""enlightened dictator"" and the rule of ""the wise"" instead of rule of the law. The emphasis on personal connections for getting things done instead of codified processes is a cultural sticking point that literally hasn't changed for thousands of years. The introduction of communism basically got married to the parts of Chinese culture and philosophical thought that always had a deference to authority, stressing order and collective good over personal freedoms.

So for US people, hk protest is just a issue of freedom but for most chinese people, Hongkong problem is part of the territorial consistency of the whole country especially when some protestors wave UK and US national flags to protest.  In this sense, for mainland Chinese people, when a US business man, who earn money from China, openly supports 'the freedom of hong kong', it makes them recall the colonized experience happened before 1949 when the country's territory was carved up by the main capitalist countries in the world. This ""century of humiliation"" is why China reacts so defensively and forcefully when they feel like their territorial consistency is challenged.

You might think the Chinese people is brainwashed badly but every country has its political/cultural taboo no matter what reason creates this taboo.",rockets

"I appreciate the long, thought-out argument you've drawn here, but that's besides the point. people take issue with how China generally conducts its business as an oppressive totalitarian regime, and Hong Kong is well within its rights to demand the retention of its civil liberties given that the two-governments-one-country system is something PRC *also* agreed to.

this is another case of opposing sides valuing different things and misunderstanding each other. if not for the videos of **police use of excessive force** and **China's history of making their dissenters disappear (cf. Tiananmen Square in '89, or basically Zedong's entire reign)**, this issue would probably not as big as it would be.

but as it stands, China seems to value its territory more than it values human lives. no matter the cultural context, that's highly immoral.

that's why pretty much nobody who 

1. doesn't have a vested capital interest in the market of China, or;
2. isn't mainland Chinese

sides with China. it's definitely deplorable for a lot of us, as their valuation of land and personal image over human rights (not even mentioning the current situation with Uighur Muslims) violates a lot of our moral principles.

perhaps the worst of all is when major American brands--both companies and individuals--kowtow to China in an attempt to save their dollars. I don't care how sensitive China is about their territory, because they haven't been very sensitive about other nations' lives and people either.

they are not more important than those who live in Tibet, Taiwan, or Hong Kong.",rockets

As for China respecting other countries, they actually follow a foreign policy of Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Chinese leadership originally enumerated these principles in 1954 when China, with a communist government, was trying to reach out to the non-communist countries of Asia.

"When you're in a station in life where people are putting microphones in your face asking you to weigh in on heavy topics, you have two options: 1.) Answer that you yourself don't have enough information to comment or 2.) Take a stance based on the information you have.   


Anyone with a brain/heart knows that China is committing human rights violations right and left. Anyone with freedom of speech/balls would take the stance that Morey did. Lebron said Morey was thinking about HIMSELF when he Tweeted what he did, but that is a lie. Morey was thinking about the people of Hong Kong and risking his livelihood to speak out in their defense. Lebron is now thinking about HIMSELF and siding with China to avoid risking his own livelihood.   


Being in the situation right now for a lot of these guys who represent the NBA does suck, and I feel bad for them, being pressured for soundbites. But it doesn't suck as bad as it does in Hong Kong right now, and that's what Morey had the balls to say that Lebron didn't. His ""non-answer"" was a pussy cop out we should all see through.",rockets

"Lebron has made it clear that he's not siding with China, just political tweets in general. He and most people probably do see what China is doing as human rights violations. That doesn't mean that it makes good business sense to take a stance.

You can see that as siding with China if you want. The NBA however is a business, not a human rights group. Not sure where the expectation is for them to speak is coming from. If that was the case, then they should be speaking up about the US too. We have a ton of problems in the US. We have cops killing innocent unarmed people and/or mass shootings more often than monthly. You want to worry about China fine but there are problems in your own hometown that the NBA can talk about too. China/HK is just the topic of the day",rockets

"Champs at Willowbrook Mall! I was trying on the shoes and I turned to look for the guy that handed them to me and I saw them on a rack. I turned them over to make sure they were for real, and they were! They also had our new red unis, but I only saw Harden's - maybe they had Westbrook's, but I wasn't really looking for his and didn't see em.",rockets
"midrange is not really the problem, it's the long twos that they really don't want. they got cp3 in the first place to seemingly help with more midrange production. the conversion rate on long 2s is not worth the shot. two shots from that range gives 4points but two shots just one or two steps back is 6 points which is basically an extra shot without taking one. for the conversion rate to balance out they would have to shoot at a much higher rate than shooting it from just a few steps back. most people don't plummet so far to make the 3 less valuable than a long 2.

and driving and being able to force defenders to account for guarding the rim helps create more space for shooters",rockets
That was a great thorough video.  Haha—the jersey is so 🔥 idk how it’s supposed to stay in stock 🤣 but I guess they’ve forecasted appropriately. Harden’s prob got some fire color-ways to unveil at the middle and later part of the season. I can’t wait!,rockets

"&gt; I think threes and layups are the best shots to take, but when you miss 7-10 threes in a row in a playoff game, you should probably throw a couple of mid ranges in to keep the defense honest. 

There are a few ideas things going on with this argument.

Firstly, if we're talking about the context where you are just cold from the 3 point line and not necessarily jacking up heavily contested 3s... MDA would still say that you have to let them shoot through it. Because of the nature of 3s being more variable of a shot compared to mid range shots, there will almost certainly be high points and low points. And the worst thing you can do as a 3 point shooting team is let a streak of  7 missed 3s in a row detur you from shooting more 3s, and as a coach you definitely shouldn't say ""if you miss X amount of 3s in a row, stop taking them and try to get easy baskets"" because that can mess with the confidence of a player. 

Now, if we're talking about a Gary Clark shooting situation where he's sub 30 from the field over the course of the whole season, yeah maybe let him get his percentage up before we let him just shoot 3s willy nilly. But people like Harden, Green, PJ, Gordon, even Westbrook. They should never be discouraged from taking good 3 point shots (relatively open ones).

Now, there is a second aspect of the original quote where if it's a case where you have a team like Utah that is defending the 3 really well, and defending the paint really well. Okay, in that case you might have to consider taking mid range jumpers. Although part of the problem with that is outside of Harden there are very few people on the team that can hit that shot with any level of efficiency. So I would probably try to run plays to get open 3s or get looks around the rim that even a guy like Gobert has a hard time defending.",rockets
Hell of a bargain.,rockets
"But I would say, even Harden in that situation where it's a pull up midrange shot... even if it's open. I don't know what the percentages are, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's a less than 50% shot for him. And at that point, you might as well just dribble out to the 3 point line (with only 1 defender on him) and go for the step back. Even semi-contested that's like a 33% shot at least for Harden.",rockets

"Free agents would take less money, but the money they have on the books would be a greater proportion.",rockets
"Honestly I don’t disagree... but it’s the analytical approach. Layups and 3’s yield more points per shot than midrange jump shots. The problem with an approach like this?

Game 7 2017. Averages and statistics don’t necessarily tell the whole story",rockets
"Think about it. Going 3/11 from 3 is better than going 4/5 shooting midrange shots.

You want to take the high percentage/efficient shots.  Drives to the rim are generally more efficient than mid range shots. 3 pointers are worth more than a mid range shot.


A team that goes shoots 60% from mid range can still lose to a team that shot 45% from 3.

3s and layups are just more efficient.",rockets
"The Jazz series... remind me... 

Did we win?",rockets
"LMAO.

That's a huge 

#NO",rockets
If we say “forced” three pointer than the open midrange sounds better but I think the threes aren’t necessarily forced into a contested attempt but forced in terms of passing up open long 2’s. The analytics still sort out until there is a way to chase shooters off the line because it’s that pervasive then maybe the pendulum swings the other way.  It’s a cost-benefit analysis or risk based model in that the risk to take a three results in a higher probability of a better outcome (for example points per possession) than a open long two. I probably butchered this choppy ass attempted explanation but hope some of it makes sense lmao.,rockets

Tucker is open so that’s a good option, but the Lob and layup is not. Ingles already forced him off the line. In my opinion the midrange is there for Harden",rockets
I never understood why people say the three is the most efficient shot. It’s the easiest shot to take but I believe the most efficient shot is the midrange and the layup,rockets
"To add onto your point even though it’s only been 2 pre season games Westbrook shooting 5 more 3s instead of midranges has drastically improved his efficiency. 

Although it would be very hard to be less efficient than Westbrook was last season his Ts% over these 2 games is 54% despite still struggling from 3.",rockets
[Steve Kerr's private photo sessions.](https://i.imgur.com/xR1NPzs.jpg),rockets
"Yep. Even though he’s been rusty, he’s at 54 TS% for the preseason.

The highest he’s been at in his career is 55% TS and that’s when OKC took 73 Warriors to 7 (15-16). I expect his TS% to be above league average especially with all the spacing around him. Cutting out those mid range shots will do wonders for his efficiency.",rockets

"""There was plenty of available minutes for a guy to come in and play 27mpg"" only if you assume that Nene and/or Faried doesn't step a single foot on the floor and ignore the fact that MDA would still run a four guard lineup for large stretches of the game. I won't assume that because although it was just spot minutes they both played well and the 4 guard lineup played well.  
  
"" can handle it well. Shumpert... not so much."" Again, the team rebounding was nearly identical to the previous season despite ""not replacing the 3 pfs"" and The Warriors don't run a big lineup either.

""You do realize there is a written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong, right? Check it again. You're objectively wrong."" Yes I am aware and I checked it before I said that, because unlike you I actually double check to make sure what i'm saying is correct and I'm not just spewing bullshit.  
  
My original comment on this thread: ""Apparently not wanting to more than double Ariza's salary makes him cheap""  
You respond: ""Not paying more than the minimum to replace the 3 rotation forwards he lost (Ariza, Luc, and Ryno) is what makes him cheap.""  
Me: ""So when a signing or trade doesn't work out it's Tilmans fault. But if Ennis or shumpert (who didn't make the minimum by the way) had turned out to be good additions something tells me you wouldn't have given him any of the credit.""   
you: ""When Tilman not only doesn't let Morey upgrade the roster, but actively makes the roster worse because of his ""no- repeater-tax"" decree...""  SO LIKE I SAID, YOU were the first one to bring up Morey. Check it again.  
  
""???"" Reading is not hard, and as you said there's a record of these things so you can go back and check if you don't get it.  
  
  
""That ROLE (big forward) was never properly replaced"" But that isn't reason enough to say Fuck Tilman and say he is sabotaging the team. That's a massive overreaction, and as I keep saying. Morey needs to bare the majority of blame for that. The cost cutting deadline moves came when we were fighting for 5th, Morey could have got a better replacement before the season started.   
"" I fault that as the reason we had more problems"" So the main problems last year were what? injuries, Capella struggling in the playoffs, everyone but Harden having a slow start, House holding out? If all 3 of them stayed. there would still be injuries, capella would have still struggled in the playoffs, House might not have ever been called up so i guess that's a problem gone. As for slow start, over the first qtr of last season Ariza averaged 9.7/5.5/3.3 and ryno had 3.7/3.0/1.1 and Luc was injured. So not exactly lighting it up.
""BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's"" No, you really shouldn't. A) because Ariza wouldn't be 33 again, Luc wouldn't be healthy again, and Anderson never regained his pre injury form, thats why he barely played in the playoffs. There is zero reason to assume that he would regain that form in 2019 when he couldn't do it in 2018. B) Why would I use their 2019 salary hits, judged off their 2018 production?  
  
""You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? "" I could misunderstanding this, but he's still listed with the $7mil in incentives, which I was under the impression counted towards matching salaries. Maybe they just didn't update it after whatever the nba ruling was, but I checked a few salary tracking websites and it's still listed. So this could be on me, but I doubt it. Although this is meaningless, there are players that actually do make the minimum on the roster.  
  
""Then explain how they aren't."" What comment is it you think I'm not addressing? I've looked through this multiple times and I have no clue what you're referring to.   
  
""I will emphasize again (since you seem to no understand my point) that the issue was not in retaining those players. The issue was not using Ryno's contract (or the MLE) to replace the role."" Ryno's role is to shoot 3s. He's not a rebounder, despite the height, or a good defender. We don't need to add anyone to get more 3s off, just play Gordon and Gerald more, which we did. plus House, Ennis, Rivers shot well.",rockets
"I will address other parts of your response later, but for now just give simple yes/no answers to whether or not you agree with these facts (the comment you can't seem to locate):

1)We were very close to winning in 2018.

2)Most teams would go ""all-in"" in those circumstances and try to upgrade the roster however possible.

3a) The MLE and Ryno's contract were our only way to upgrade the roster without moving core players in trades, but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax.

3b) 23 of the 32 Finals teams in the tax-paying era have paid luxury tax (and 12 of 16 Champions).

4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling {*forwards 6'8"" or taller*} and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)...

5) Iman Shumpert (who had played guard virtually his entire career up to that point due at least in part to being 'small' by league standards), who was the only player to emerge from Ryno's contract after all the dealing was done, and is not likely to be signed this season.

"I lived In China for a bit when I was a kid (early 2000s).

Back than my uncle loved to wake up early in the morning and watch China’s version of Sportscenter, and I clearly remember that back then the intro was filled with montages from Yao Ming and the Rockets by majority. The soundtrack for the intro was Rocket Man by Elton John. I didn’t know Elton back then but I thought the song was beautiful to listen to in the early morning. 

I became a casual Rockets and NBA fan because I really like Yao Ming - not just because his Chinese, but also his sense of humour (he said that his favourite song was the American anthem because he listens to it 82 times during the season) and his playing style. When he retired in 2011 due to a long term injury I feel a bit sad. I thanked my uncle for exposing me to NBA and Basketball both as a sport to play and a sport to spend your pastime watching.

With all that said, I think that the recent controversy between Rockets and China should not have happened. What I mean is that The Morey tweet could have been a great window for young Chinese fans to truly understand what’s going on in HK with a more objective and critical lens, but the way the government and certain Chinese fans on the Internet handled it really disappointed me. But I guess to a majority of you it’s a blessing in disguise since it exposed to you a lot of the dark stuff that’s going on in China. I feel bad that this turned out that way because there are a lot of people in China who simply wants to enjoy basketball, the Rockets and the NBA, and now they got stuck in a hard place. 

That’s just my perspective.",rockets

"If you acquire a player that is better than Nenê or Faried, why would they play over him? Don't use idiotic arguments just to argue.

Parker and Portis don't play for Washington... They clearly weren't the reason the Wiz traded away Porter... It was strictly a salary dump.

Knight and Chriss also would have decreased their salary commitment, and while yes, a pick would have needed to go, too, it's not like we didn't send out picks anyways... Maybe the Wiz don't like that deal (despite clearly not being in contention this year and being as good a spot as any for Knight to try to regain his play), but it's extremely disingenuous to assume we couldn't have made a trade work out if we had wanted to try... We could have at least brought in Sacramento and sent Shumpert's expiring to Washington, too (if they chose to dump salary over getting the pick)... There were absolutely multiple (better) deals to offer Washington than the pure salary dump they opted for - *if* we were willing to pay the price.",rockets

Woah. I just read it now, it actually seems quite direct and not his only Tweet on the matter. Kerr has shared links for things going on in China too a few years ago it seems. Shame he is pretending to not know anything about the Country now.

""Bibi backsliding. Boris flailing. Hong Kong rising. The authotorian trend is not inevitable. Fight back. It will work.""

standing up for justice, freedom and democracy is a right thing to do.

when parts of the world are censoring itself, we have an bigger need to stick out neck out to voice out. this is the true value of freedom of expression and it's how a civilised society should be. if we decided not to talk about it by ourselves, that means we're bowing down to CCP and the totalitarian dictatorship.

"&gt;""Then simply answer the question. Which of the facts do you take issue with?"" I've already answered that. Simply learn basic reading comprehension.

Answer my first response directly then. Yes or no. If yes, you need say nothing more, but if you want to express the issue you have with any ""no"", then please be explicit about which words or phrases you take issue with and whether or not you agree with the other aspects... Maybe even provide an alternate ""fact"" as you see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""You do realize there is a written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong, right? Check it again. You're objectively wrong."" Yes I am aware and I checked it before I said that, because unlike you I actually double check to make sure what i'm saying is correct and I'm not just spewing bullshit.

Okay, my bad... You're right on that one. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My original comment on this thread: ""Apparently not wanting to more than double Ariza's salary makes him cheap""You respond: ""Not paying more than the minimum to replace the 3 rotation forwards he lost (Ariza, Luc, and Ryno) is what makes him cheap.""Me: ""So when a signing or trade doesn't work out it's Tilmans fault. But if Ennis or shumpert (who didn't make the minimum by the way) had turned out to be good additions something tells me you wouldn't have given him any of the credit.""you: ""When Tilman not only doesn't let Morey upgrade the roster, but actively makes the roster worse because of his ""no- repeater-tax"" decree...""  SO LIKE I SAID, YOU were the first one to bring up Morey. Check it again.

I was responding incorrectly to:

""Ok if that's how it goes down, than Morey is the one suggesting we sign Ennis or whoever, **yet you give him 0% of the blame**. But if its Austin Rivers Fertita signs off on, **You give Morey 100% of the credit**. **THAT is the issue**. That is the point. Not any of the other paragraphs of bullshit you typed.""

This bugs in a way bigger way than me dropping his name once in a peripheral example and then forgetting about it (because it was so inconsequential to my main point I hadn't put any mental focus whatsoever on it).

You assert ""THAT is the issue""... But it's not... It's not even close to the issue... I'm not even considering it on any level and if you want to say Morey is to blame, too, then I'm all for it. I've said many times on this sub that it is the biggest mistake of his tenure (Tbf, he's got a new one now... bad streak for him).

But the point is that in this thread I had never credited Morey one way or the other, and even if I had, it is FAR from ""the issue"". The issue is that our team is getting worse and that it is because we are actively making it worse in an effort to avoid the tax. And Tilman very publicly threatened Morey's job security if he paid too much tax. So it's a pretty clear connection that Morey would try to cut costs to keep him happy. And Tilman has been rubber-stamping it every step of the way... As opposed to suggesting we actually maximize our Championship chances by paying for some depth to provide James with the best roster possible (or at least a second playable forward).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""???"" Reading is not hard, and as you said there's a record of these things so you can go back and check if you don't get it.

You say it's ""weird"". 

How is it weird? It makes perfect sense to compare 2019 to 2018 to see how the roster was affected under his leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""That ROLE (big forward) was never properly replaced"" But that isn't reason enough to say Fuck Tilman and say he is sabotaging the team. 

Well, I never said either of those things (my response is much more muted as I understand it is his team to do with as he pleases)... but sure it is. Way more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's a massive overreaction, 

No it's not. Harden's prime is ticking away and we just wasted an MVP-level season.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and as I keep saying. Morey needs to bare the majority of blame for that. The cost cutting deadline moves came when we were fighting for 5th, Morey could have got a better replacement before the season started.

I wish he had, and yeah... he screwed up last off-season, too, but the trade deadline was the most critical moment, because as Morey assured us many times, it's not the team you have in October, but the one in March that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" I fault that as the reason we had more problems"" So the main problems last year were what? injuries, Capella struggling in the playoffs, everyone but Harden having a slow start, House holding out? If all 3 of them stayed. 

Imma stop you right there. I've said multiple times that I don't fault letting them go... I fault not replacing the role. I thought we were looking for an upgrade, but apparently they were fine with downgrading if it meant a better bottom line.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;there would still be injuries, capella would have still struggled in the playoffs, House might not have ever been called up so i guess that's a problem gone. As for slow start, over the first qtr of last season Ariza averaged 9.7/5.5/3.3 and ryno had 3.7/3.0/1.1 and Luc was injured. So not exactly lighting it up. ""BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's"" No, you really shouldn't. A) because Ariza wouldn't be 33 again, Luc wouldn't be healthy again, and Anderson never regained his pre injury form, thats why he barely played in the playoffs. There is zero reason to assume that he would regain that form in 2019 when he couldn't do it in 2018. B) Why would I use their 2019 salary hits, judged off their 2018 production?  
&gt;  
&gt;""You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? "" I could misunderstanding this, but he's still listed with the $7mil in incentives, which I was under the impression counted towards matching salaries. 

Those only count if he hits games played thresholds (he won't unless we are really searching to pay him more... We have 3-5 other center possibilities) at the end of the year and he needs to be on a 52-win team for them to kick in. He will be waived by mid-February or the second year kicks in. And it won't be by us. The only question is if he will be traded for something or nothing. But if it's something, it won't be a big something unless he's combined with other players.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe they just didn't update it after whatever the nba ruling was, but I checked a few salary tracking websites and it's still listed. So this could be on me, but I doubt it.

lol 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Although this is meaningless, there are players that actually do make the minimum on the roster.

Yeah. Your point?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Then explain how they aren't."" What comment is it you think I'm not addressing? I've looked through this multiple times and I have no clue what you're referring to.

So yeah, before you reply to any of the pointless bullcrap in this comment, go back and give the Yes/No answers to the 5 facts... They are critical to the actual point... unlike 'who typed the word ""Morey"" first'.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I will emphasize again (since you seem to no understand my point) that the issue was not in retaining those players. The issue was not using Ryno's contract (or the MLE) to replace the role."" Ryno's role is to shoot 3s. He's not a rebounder, despite the height, or a good defender. We don't need to add anyone to get more 3s off, just play Gordon and Gerald more, which we did. plus House, Ennis, Rivers shot well.

Note that none of the guys you mentioned ever spent time as our small-ball 5.

Height matters.",rockets

"I think threes and layups are the best shots to take, but when you miss 7-10 threes in a row in a playoff game, you should probably throw a couple of mid ranges in to keep the defense honest. I think that a healthy shot diet in the playoffs  is something like 30-35 threes (unless you’re hot. Then shoot more than that), 30-35 shots at the rim, and 5-15 mid ranges (almost none when the team is hot from three and more than a hand full for when they aren’t hot from three). The way teams defend us, mid ranges are open shots. Math doesn’t matter nearly as much in the playoffs due to the small sample size.

As for Kerr and the rest of the NBA goes, I don't blame them for caring about issues close to home and feeling apathy towards issues in other countries.

Before all this, did you even know about Hong Kong? Did you speak up for Hong Kong?

Did you speak and take action against Duerte in the Philippines or against Spain for Catalan when Spain crushed their popular independence movement? Or against France when they cracked down on the Yellow Vest movement the way China is cracking down in Hong Kong

The answer? No. Don't lie. You haven't heard of most of them. The incidences you vaguely heard about, you didn't care enough to find out more. The ones you do know about, you didn't care enough to do anything about. Because those are problems in counties far away that doesn't affect us. And you're not going to start now.

You know what effects us? Trump wanting to be like Xi and trying to turn us into his personal China. And that's why the speak out about these issues.

Freedom of speech means freedom to abstain as well, let him abstain in peace.

The US and world governments can't even figure out what the hell to do about China, I'm sure Kerr has an opinion here but if voicing it gains practically nothing but may cost his colleagues (like Klay with his Anta contract) millions, may cost the team he works for hundreds of millions in valuation, and may cost the league billions, that's a lot of other people's money to be thinking about when the only real benefit of condemning china is appeasing the naive US twitter mobs who've never had to consider the consequences to themselves and the people around them when they take principled stances, and have never once had those principles tested in the face of something as fraught as the issues between China and the nba.",rockets

We hypothetically trade for this big, how many minutes do you think he gets? MDA would still run a 7/8 man rotation, and Tucker would still play basically the whole game. So he gets up to 10 minutes, less depending on how much we run Shumpert or the 4 guard lineup.

"""(and no... they don't even come close to proving my point wrong, either). Hence why I brought things back to the point."" Except regardles of your refusal to admit it, they absolutely prove your point wrong.  You can't say ""fertita won't go into the luxary tax, that's costing us. Bring back Les"" When A) Les only went into the Tax twice. and B) the issue wasn't the lucary tax, it's the repeater tax.  
""What are you talking about here?"" You can pretend that you were talking about 2017/18, but when you spend 80% of the time complaining about Shumpert and Ennis or how we didn't replace luc and Ariza...
  

""Fertitta signs off on all major moves and we know this from interviews with him"" Signs off on. It's still Morey that is scouting, choosing, negotiating with for all the players. Morey is still in control of the franchise. But You are blaming Fertita for not replacing players to your liking. Fertita just sings the checks, which despite what you want to believe, are far larger than they were when Les owned the team.  
  
""Again. It's just a fact. I want to know if you agree or not. Although I guess I should ask you... Are you aware that paying the luxury tax last year would not have meant paying the repeater tax until possibly the 2022 season?"" Yes I'm aware. That's why I kept saying Avoid and delay the repeaters tax. We're already over the cap now, chances are we're paying it this year
  
""Use your line-up checker to see how often they played PF for us. Coming from the person who is trying to call Shumpert a suitable Forward replacement, this is laughable."" Ariza played 30% of his minutes at pf. Shumpert played 85% of his minutes at foward last year. What's laughable is that you cant fathom calling Shumpert anything but the position he spend 15% of his minutes at, but heaven forbid I call our starting small foward for half a decade a small forward.  
  
The 10 most used lineups with Mbah a Moute on the floor:  
Paul/Harden/Luc/Tucker/Capella: 130 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Capella: 73 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 62 minutes  
Paul/Harden/Luc/Anderson/Capella:58: minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Ariza/Luc/Capella: 55 Minutes
Harden/Ariza/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 56 Minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Anderson/Capella: 47 Minutes  
Harden/Ariza/Luc/Tucker/Capella:38 minutes  
Paul/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Nene: 32 minutes  
Harden/Gordon/Luc/Tucker/Anderson: 30 Minutes
  
So out of one of those lineups, He was the PF for 55 minutes, but since according to you Ariza was a pf, you might argue that Luc was actually playing the 3 in that lineup too. But sure, it's laughable.  
  
  
""Source?"" Just look up the starting lineups from his first year in Pheonix. How is a 6'6"" guy playing at guard so unbelievable to you that you need a source for that of all things?  
  
""If Morey brings him several options of trade targets,"" Ok if that's how it goes down, than Morey is the one suggesting we sign Ennis or whoever, yet you give him 0% of the blame. But if its Austin Rivers Fertita signs off on, You give Morey 100% of the credit. THAT is the issue. That is the point. Not any of the other paragraphs of bullshit you typed.  
  
""But again... the point is just to clarify that we turned Ryan Anderson's $20M contract into Shumpert and nothing else (and maybe we should throw in cost to do it? I believe it ended up being a first, a second or two, and Melton, right?)"" are you suggesting that I liked that trade or thought it was a good idea? because I hated that trade at the time, and I hated it more when the suns were able to get more for Ryno than we did. But again, the point of this whole thing is you give all the blame of this to Fertita, when Morey is the one actually negotiating the deals. That's just laughable.",rockets

It’s not up to us or anyone not from China to worry about that, let their country develop on their own. 

I will say it’s pathetic the way China reacted to the tweet and it makes them look very weak, like a child chucking a tantrum until they get what they want. The situation is dying down now and it’s time to let it go, the focus of the nba should be on basketball, not politics.",rockets

This *is* my main complaint against him... what do you think I'm trying to say?


&gt; ""We had the best team in the league and he has systematically worsened it through personnel decisions"" So based on the 3 decisions you claim as the example of him systematically worsening the team.

And we all know Ryno was the missing piece to beating the warriors.

That **ROLE** (big forward) was never properly replaced, and yes, I fault that as the reason we had more problems. I have no problem with letting those particular players go. I have a problem with not filling the role (BTW, you should use 2018 numbers including regular season to gauge the impact of those 3 guys... not last year's)

&gt; Note 4: Nene was signed as a trade asset, to help match salary. You understand there will be salary coming back right?

You understand that minimum salary guys don't need to be salary matched, right? We can do with him the same thing we did with Melo and MCW last year... send him and some cash off to another team for a heavily protected second rounder that we will never receive in order to avoid him appearing on our salary obligations 

&gt; ""going back to my comment a few comments ago, just indicate which of the facts (with number 4's revision to height accounted for"" I don't disagree with facts, you just not stating facts.

"MDA is fine with a short rotation in the playoffs.

We had 6 proven guys:

Harden, CP3, Gordon, and Rivers are all guards. PJ is a forward and Clint is a center.

There was plenty of available minutes for a guy to come in and play 27mpg. If that guy were a big forward it would have been a perfect fit to allow him, Clint, and PJ to fill all 96 front court minutes (and would have amounted to at least 27mpg)

"Yeah not that communist China is any great shakes....but I kind of find all of this nationalist finger wagging from Americans right now to be kind of laughable...way more than what these guys listed, if you look back in our history, it's not as if we have much of a moral high ground to stand on. 

They have Muslim reeducation camps, we've slaughtered between 2-3 million innocent muslims since starting the war on terror, which was started for absolutely bogus reasons. Their military budget is about 1/4 of ours. 

Just because they forcibly limit free speech with government action, and we structurally limit it with minority disenfranchisement, corporate-media, distractionary 24 hr news cycles, sports, echo chambers, and outrage culture, etc...Instead of their overt corruption, we extend ""free speech"" interpretations to legally let corporations buy all of our politicians. 

Again, not saying that we are equal to communist china...just saying that these mods do have some degree of a point....Americans criticizing anyone about human rights and/or treatment of muslims is sort of laughable.",rockets

"&gt; Everyone stands to lose money, refs included.  

\-In what way? I'm like 99% sure that the refs won't lose ANY money from what went down in China. They relatively cheap labor compared to Coaches, Players, Owners and other High Level Team employees. And their salary isn't tied to the salary cap. There is no way the NBA would tie their salaries to what the NBA makes as a whole.

In general there is no way the Rockets would lose because of the games being fixed , for multiple reasons:

\-In order to make the Rockets lose games, you need to fix said games. Which means not just 1 ref, multiple refs at the very least. And because above we've already established that refs have ABSOLUTELY 0 motivation to want to fix games for any specific team (out side of them having money on the other team) that means likely the motivation would have to come from somewhere else. It would have to be someone like Adam Silver who both hypothetically could control refs in some way and someone who lost something big due to what went down with this whole China mess. 

\-Lets say for the sake of argument that it's even possible to somewhat coordinate with a bunch of refs and effectively fix several games against the Rockets (it probably isn't but might as well not even try to argue that point). It definitely will be hard to fix these games without any evidence being left that is easy to find or any whistleblowers or anyone suddenly noticing the officiating being unusually bad against the Rockets.

\-Fixing games against the Rockets in the regular season will have very little effect unless we're talking about close to a 8 games at least. If it's only like 4 games, that maybe knocks them down from the 2nd seed to the 5th maybe. But that seems like a lot of work to be doing and risking your career just for so little effect. And once you get past 8 games, the more chance people figure it out (as pointed out in above point).

\-And finally, this final point was kind of implied the whole time with the past few points but it still bears restating. If Silver were to get caught, at the very least loses his job. Dude has only been Commish for a few years and so I doubt he has the capital with the owners to survive such a scandal. Especially if it happens after the China debacle. 

&amp;#x200B;

So all of those reasons are reasons why it wouldn't happen. But on top of that, there are probably ways someone like Silver (or any 1 person) could get back at Morey and/or the Rockets that are less risky but are just as effective. 

\-Fix a game yes, but have it be only 1 game. Have it be a playoff game. There is obviously a bigger chance for 1 win or loss against a tough opponent (even if it was game 1) to be the difference in making it out of the series. 

\-Drug James Harden before an important game so that he is less effective. And while we are making jokes... kidnapping/killing Rockets players too would accomplish the same goal but would be less risky than a conspiracy formed with refs to fix a bunch of Rockets games. Hell... since he has an issue with Morey, seems like going straight to the source and offing Morey would be the best revenge.",rockets

"America is standing with Daryl Morey.

He's not going to be fired for this.

And the league is certainly not going to seek retribution against the Rockets (If anything tin-foil comes true, I'd think that helping them get to the Finals would be an interesting ploy to try to force China back into the fold)",rockets
Hope so.,rockets
"Eh... it's possible. 

Part of the issue too is that the Wolves don't necessarily need to get rid of cap room. They aren't even in luxury tax land yet. And it doesn't really make sense for them to offload salary with the purposes of getting under the cap because they won't be under it enough to do anything interesting anyway. Dieng's deal ends after 2020-2021 season. Meaning it will be an expiring for next season making it much easier to deal away if they wanted to. 

Actually, it seems like the most likely way Covington is involved in a deal as a means to shed salary is if Andrew Wiggins' salary is involved. He's looking at making around 30 millionish for the next 4 years. If you realize this season it obviously isn't working with him and Towns. Doing a mini-rebuild and trying to build a somewhat competitive team before KAT's deal expires might be a solid play.",rockets

"You are arguing a lot of points that are completely irrelevant seemingly just for the sake of arguing.

So I'm just going to point out the obvious facts again and you tell me what you take issue with.

1) We were very close to winning in 2018.

2) Most teams would go ""all-in"" in those circumstances and try to upgrade the roster however possible.

3a) The MLE and Ryno's contract were our only way to upgrade the roster without moving core players in trades, but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax.

3b) 23 of the 32 Finals teams in the tax-paying era have paid luxury tax (and 12 of 16 Champions). 

4) We let go of 3 major-minute filling PFs and replaced their minutes with minimum-contract signings and (eventually)...

5) Iman Shumpert (who had played guard virtually his entire career up to that point due at least in part to being 'small' by league standards), who was the only player to emerge from Ryno's contract after all the dealing was done, and is not likely to be signed this season.

So of those facts, where do you disagree?",rockets

"Lol can someone tell him to read his own book? Honestly I don’t give two fucks about this dude. 

As a fan it seems like he’s attempting to do his best to capitalize on the opportunity we have with an absolutely elite once in a lifetime player in Harden. Score = good. 

As a businessman he’s trying to maximize profits. Score = good. 

As a patriot and a decent human being he’s sacrificing human rights and democratic values. Score = fuck that shit dude. 

Let’s take this from two perspectives. 

Scenario 1: I’m a young salesperson from a poor background trying to support my family. I have a big deal from China being worked on that could elevate my station in life. Am I going to let human rights and democratic values get in the way of that?  Probably not if we’re being honest. Sad but true. 

Scenario 2: I’m a billionaire. I’ll be okay if China tells me to fuck off. I should tell them to fuck off.

"CP3 was upset because he lost his iso god powers. It worked fine when CP3 was on Harden’s level for isolation play. That being said, we do need to change it up.

Harden is better on ball than Westbrook is, but Harden has more off ball skills than Westbrook does. Harden needs to compromise for this to work.

"I just downvoted your comment.

# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",rockets
"Morey told Russ how to increase his TS% by taking 3s instead of midrange jumpers :) 

He is shooting 54%TS in his first two preseason games compared to 50%TS last season. 
That all in rather poor preseason showings. He should get up to at least league average scoring with the Rockets. 

Rockets beat writers have been talking about his timings being off because he couldn’t play 5vs5 at all during rehab. In his second game his passes were still somewhat inaccurate for his standards but still an improvement from his first game. Offense will be fine, rebounding on the other hand....

"&gt;Yet, we all partake in self-censorship do we not?

No, we don't.

Not saying something rude for no particular reason is not the same as self-censorship. You're setting up a false equivalency.

&gt; It's not his job, nor will it ever be his job to make political commentary

Political discourse is the ""job"" of every American citizen. Anyone that is actually paid to be a political commentator is chiefly concerned with making money and is beholden to their corporate masters, not actually expressing themselves freely.

You're completely missing the point. This censorship sets a dangerous precedent and has a wider reach than just the NBA. Look at the recent debacle at Blizzard. Or in Hollywood.

"Offense is unreal. We ain't even clicking yet but you can see we're going to be even more exciting this year. We shot like dog shit from 3 but remained neck and neck with the raps. 

Russ is looking pretty good from what I can see. He's already erased the mid-range from his game which is really impressive considering how much he has relied on it and it's only his 2nd game. He looks smooth from the ft line too. If he gets that back to career averages his ts% gets a very nice boost. 

Still very concerned about the defense. We did a better job of not getting caught on doubles leaving a wide open dunker, but we still gave up way too many open 3s. We have real trouble once a play starts breaking down or in to scrambles and improv. Hopefully in time with consistent rotations and guys learning their spots better this won't carry on, but it looks like our biggest weakness to me right now.

we all know Harden doesn't mean it in that environment. Actually, you don't know what china is. I am chinese and i dont know exactly Uyghur and Tibet history events. China goverment did something bad i think in history. Which goverment is clean in history or even now? US? And it is not related to the Morey's  problem.

Come to china to take a look if you have chance in the future. Don't believe cnn/bcc. Public Media is the worst thing in the world including china media. Uyghur, Tibet and all other  Minority group (china has 56  Nationality) has more rights . China has lots of problems ..but we dont have racism problem.  

Morey can speak china is not good, china has lots of pollution, china is not good to help poors, chinese is not good at basketball etc.  Nobody will diss him.  The only thing he can't speak is hongkong/taiwan problem.  It is the same as racism in your country.

"I m a Chinese here and I do agree with you on the part that supporting democracy is not the same as being racist. But it is not as simple as you said. I went to their website [https://standwithhk.org/](https://standwithhk.org/). their top agenda is to urge China to honor the 1984 agreement with Britain which grantees hongkong 50yrs of high degree autonomy. While I totally think it is reasonable, the protest has evolved into violent demonstration which even involves burning Chinese banks and Chinese electronic stores, painting separatism words at the stores they looted, check these photos by CNN [https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/asia/hong-kong-protest-migration-intl-hnk/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/asia/hong-kong-protest-migration-intl-hnk/index.html). Clearly some people within the protest group are trying to do actual damage or even represent separatism, which goes way back since the handover in 1997. Nobody within the protest group is taking responsibilities or make a statement for any of these damages, and hence it is impossible for Chinese government to actually open a channel for dialogue with them. And at this very moment Morey, the GM of the most beloved NBA team, posted support for the movement. What do you think China will do? The government can't distinguish who within the protest group is benevolent and who are the violent ones because they all claim to be under the same agenda, so the only thing they can do is to show strength by asking for an apology, at least say sorry for posting without knowing the whole truth; but nobody in the US was listening, everybody just standing at the moral highground and bashing us, we are deeply hurt.

I love NBA, been a die hard Rocket fan for over a decade, went through thick and thin with HTown basketball; but like the dude before you said, separatism has brought too much pain and blood to us in the past thousands of years, we have to stand together.

You’re right— Harden jumps off his left leg (his strong side). I’m jumping off my strong side as well. I noticed even though it is opposite of how you would conventionally lay-up (e.g., jump off left leg for right handed lay-ups) it gives more alignment and base going up from that foot into the shot and I’ve gotten very used to it.  It’s effective. If he sustains many successes during the season it will spread but it requires that leg strength.",rockets

"Cause freedom of expression is a universal value. It's rational for all human beings to be allowed to express themselves. All humans are about the same order of magnitude in intelligence. You have to be rational and modest to understand other humans beings are as intelligent and as smart as you are. You can't read people's minds or scan their brains. Therefore you must allow their freedom of expression, to understand them and to converge towards truth.

At this time, the NBA would ban racist comments which hurt Americans a lot but support the HKer's behaviors hurt Chinese a lot, that's the double standard. The 'freedom of expression' should not work in the field that hurt you, but can work in the field that hurt Chinese.",rockets

"Cool, but I never said anything about freedom of expression. I am not discussing the issue with that. OF COURSE there is an issue with freedom of expression in China. 

I doubt every one is about the same magnitude in intelligence. If it was the case, communication would have been way easier, but that is beside the point.

Only because we can't read each others minds, we should try our best to communicate with others in a meaningful way. I am not disallowing anyone's freedom of speech. But I am judging whether this person's actions were productive to his goal, assuming that his goal was to highlight the problem with freedom of speech(banning Houston Rockets). With his actions he only managed to aggravate his fellow countrymen and nobody cared about his message. So the results suggest that burning a flag, or attempting to burn a flag, is not the most useful thing to do when you are trying to protest in China. Not only in China, but anywhere on a globe I imagine. What does it accomplish? You may dislike nationalists, but people generally have a strong affiliation with their homeland. I don't think there is anything wrong with it. When you are insulting people, you don't really get your message across. It was not a critique, but rather provocative act.

"While the official flag, pretty sure this is not a true representation of the spirit of Hong Kong.

&gt; The regional flag carries a design of five bauhinia petals, each with a star in the middle, on a red background. The red flag represents the motherland and the bauhinia represents Hong Kong. The design implies that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China and prospers in the embrace of the motherland. The five stars on the flower symbolise the fact that all Hong Kong compatriots love their motherland, while the red and white colours embody the principle of ""one country, two systems",rockets

They get boo'ed on a personal level, harassed, called names and it seems to be a part of the game for them...

"It's easy to raise enough money for the physical T-Shirts, the problem is going to be logistics in terms of handing them out and getting people to wear them

Toyota/Staples center might not let you pass them out on arena property, and you have to have volunteers or employees handing them out somewhere where people can actually get them. And then you have to get a significant number of actual fans (who have probably barely been paying attention to the controversy) to wear the things. Ideally you'd get enough people to wear them that the TV cameras have no choice but to show them.

"&gt; Free speech guarantees are for public and government settings, not private businesses.

"it’s more so people aren’t aware of the entire China/HK situation so they can’t place in context what it means. 

There are already high tensions between China and the US because of trade wars. China has already successfully induced our President and Government to remain quiet on HK, because we want to come to a trade deal.

Since Morey publicly criticized them for an issue that the United States already agreed not to do, it seems China may be responding in a manner consistent with any one breaking that agreement/concession to remain quiet on HK.

Maybe you can hold it against him for not going over the cap for Iggy, but I wouldnt. I guess there was the case of him using emails the rockets acquired to push his book/ other ventures, but that seems like kinda of a minor thing. He has also been really good with reviving the UH basketball program so I think Houston's sports is something he actually cares about 

As far as Tillmans statement about Morey. Did Tillman really say anything diffrent from Silvers 2nd statement? Other than maybe Tillman didnt use as much lawyer terms, both statements are pretty much summed up as ""Morey has his personal opions, and dosnt reflect the NBA/Rockets .

"Yes, I agree that understanding the distinction between cultural and governmental authoritarianism is important in this mess. However, how fair is it really to say that it is their culture that propels their government, and not the other way around? In the end, it is their government that is armed and choses what they can or cannot see, and what they are allowed to speak on. 

A key factor in authoritarian societies, including the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, are using pre-existing cultural structures to form a nationalistic attitude to excuse their own censorship and mass murder of the people in their borders. These extreme actions in turn end up benefitting those who turn a blind eye and attach themselves to the system the most.  In that regard, I think you are giving China's authoritarian aspects too much credit for what is realistically an un-original reboot taking place in the 21st century.

In any case, excusing attrocities commited on defenseless innocents stuck within a country in the modern day is reprehensible. It's not worth considering the cultural roots are entertwined with a society like that, because those roots were always meant to be a means to an end, and are most likely hollow already.",rockets

It's a lot easier to integrate HK into China the more similarities they have which is why people were so afraid of the bridge from HK to China, the more linkages China creates, the easier the transition will be when 1c2s is no more.

I know as a corporation the NBA and it’s owners, like Fertitta, care more about the market in China than the promotion of democracy and rights such as the freedom of speech.

Boycotting private Chinese companies will do very little for anyone. It’s pointless and extremely difficult to do effectively. Speaking out and supporting Hong Kong, however, may actually make some kind of marginal difference to their political future; international pressure on South Africa, combined with the heroism of South African activists, was what ended Apartheid.",rockets

Take away the horrible start by the team and looking at what he was after coming back from injury, he was every bit as good in Houston as he was in Philly.

Obviously Green is the player I'm referencing as being helpful. Look at what Shumpert, Green, and House did in their time on the court...

40 points 19 boards 1 assist 3 steals 1 block 6 turnovers in 161 minutes.

Essentially 6.7p / 3.2r / 0.2a / .5s / 0.2b / 1to per game (27 minutes per game)

"A)it's not literally the entire conference if you say minus 3 teams.  
B)You can be the 6 seed with a losing record in the East. making the playoffs doesn't mean being a good team over there. 
C)It can't be both the owner's job to make sure they put a competitive product on the floor and tanking, aka the opposite of being competitive, is a good job. 
D) Also if you're gonna list teams that are ""bad now and in the future"", you can't leave off half the teams that tanked last year, it's not a one year process. How can you say the suns are in a good position for the future?
E)Whether it's because of incompetence or not is irrelevant to the fact that you think the commissioner can kick an owner out of the league for not at least making an earnest attempt to put together a good competitive team. Teams go decades with out even sniffing the playoffs, and you think Silver would kick out Tilman when the team has so far at least been a title contender 100% of his time as owner.

"34% is league average which is pretty good considering he isn’t the best shooter, but if you couple that with the optimism that he will return to a good free throw percentage (75-85%) then he massively improves the team , and his own offense.

The shot improvement will stop teams just sagging off him and daring him to shoot, which in turn will allow him to get better looks at the rim + easier to create opportunities for the rest of the team. 

And if the free throw improves his willingness to get to the freethrow line will also improve again, resulting in easy points for the team.",rockets

Secondly there is no loss of not watching a team that disrespected your country. The real loss is the loss in HOU’s revenue. Thirdly I know you’re brainwashed by the Western Propaganda but you need to know that not everything is driven by the Chinese government . If you’re capable of doing your own research in Chinese community, you will find out it is the people themselves pissed off by Hou and expressing their feelings. There is nothing about feeling unsecured or whatever you tried to claim, it’s a gesture to show that you can’t shit at will.",rockets
"Interesting? First, I did **not** group all commenters as a bot. I generally characterized that it is happening pervasively based on observation.

Lastly, I enjoy the freedom or have being blessed to be self-sufficient enough to sit my family and I near the court at HOU games in LA, SF (x-mas baby!), and hopefully a few roadies and playoff games this season. I’m just pointing out that the comments are annoying if you use the platform for sports and so for the time being I will control what I can and not visit the comments on certain platforms. 

I certainly read certain comments I feel that I probably won’t like (this pointy one for example).

"Yeah I agree with fans being able to express their feels — and there is nothing wrong with Morey expressing his feelings as well but he absentmindedly did not vet this with the Rockets public relations department. That was a huge mistake if this is your point. There is another post about the positive side (branding) but it’s not super serious. It’s just trying to find bright spots in a dark situation. That’s all.  My guy that is close to the Rockets and in Asia right now is saying this thing could actually get worst (my understanding was it **may** get better). There will need to be something direct to address from Morey himself. 

One thing that should be highlighted is for years Morey has been very engaging with his fans and vocal on Social Media. He’s one of the smartest minds in basketball and globally respected as you know. Even though he advised for Danny Ainge — Ainge views Morey, the “Slippery Eel”, as a godsend to the games. 

His hyperactivity on social media and engagement with fans ultimately led to this mishap unfortunately and this is why other GMs and Coaches (not Kerr) avoid social media entirely for fear of something like this happening. It it unfortunate bc I have been able to have direct interaction with one of my fav GMs — Bobby on the Raptors being another as a childhood acquaintance of mine.  And now — we will see what unfolds. Terrible situation, that I am acknowledging but you control what you can going forward (not an Asian mentality for saving face and permanent consequences for those unfortunate or fortunate — i.e., lucky).

Edit: there is also danger to this for Americans as a clash in how things are done — a slippery slope. If Morey is fired, there will still be anger but just from another group — the larger NBA market currently and it’s constituents.

"I like our logo as well. It’s different than the rest of the league, and we have significant history with it now (all of Yao and TMac, Now James, CP, Russ). Usually it takes Nike around ~2 seasons to come up with a completely new logo, uniform set, court design, merch, etc. so I think if anything get something ready, and then make the change after James eventually retires, for the new chapter of the Rockets. But I would really prefer just keeping the logo and doing things differently with the uniform style and colors. I honestly prefer our previous uniforms to these new ones (not including throwback). The new ones just look so generic to me, like ncaa create-a-team Rockets. Especially the font",rockets

"I think in the business world employees have been fired for less, but Morey does have a lot of job security being being in a high position in the organization (and a really hard position to replace at that). 

That said this whole situation has morphed beyond an employees tweets and kinda into the realm of Chinese vs Western views.

I can see Tillman losing some support in America if he bends over too much trying to reopen the chinese market. If Tillman fires Morey he would lose some support from his American market. With China really effectively closing its Market to the Rockets I guess Tillman has a couple of choices. Wait out the Chinese, bend over backwards for them to open up their markets again, or maybe just take a PR win in America and publicly support HK.

Personally I dont know what Tillman will do. Fire Morey would lose home support, but firing Morey would probably open the Chinese market to the Rockets the fastest. Like I said this thing has morphed from a tweet to really a China vs Western Ideals area of debate and whatever Tillman does is really going to be telling of what the ""Fertitta era"" of the Rockets organization is all about.",rockets

And I seriously doubt Morey gets fired. If he were a mediocre GM, it's easy for guys to lose their jobs over stuff like this. But Morey is arguably the best GM in the NBA (definitely in the top 3) and Tilman is the new owner that already is kind of finding it hard to gain the respect from Rockets fans. If he fires Morey over this, Tilman would face a HUGE backlash from the fans. 

And it has nothing to do with Tilman ""quieting"" the man who stood his ground and said something about what is going on in China. It would be a case of Tilman just making a bad basketball decision and getting rid of the man who is the biggest reason why Houston is in the position they are in right now.",rockets
"I support Morey. In my opinion he's 10000% correct. Besides that, he's the reason that the organization has been where it's been when many teams just gave up.

"One silver lining to come out of this whole incident. The fact that Morey was comfortable enough to say something controversial means that he probably believes has the respect/trust of the lockerroom and management staff far more than Tilman does.

And what I mean by that is, I think there were some people who feared that Tilman would come in and try to be controlling and make bad moves and Morey might buckle under pressure because he feels he might get fired (or he just doesn't want to disagree with owner for other reasons) if he steps out of line.

But being comfortable enough to say stuff like this kind of tells me that Tilmans presence on the team isn't going to effect his decision making.",rockets

"I'm not sure what you mean by losing capital. Do you mean that figuratively or are you saying he might get fined? 

I could see the NBA maybe fining him some customary amount just to make it look like they are distancing themselves from him (although I don't think there is precedent for fines for stuff like this, but I suppose there always is a first).

I don't see Tilman fining him. Or at the very least, I would be worried for the future of the team if he did. 

One of the things I worry about is not Morey getting fired, but that he would leave Houston at some point. And 3 years ago I would've said Morey would never leave Houston because of the respect the city has for him and all of the work he's done. But there is a real chance he could if he just really doesn't get along with Tilman and in about 5 or so years there is the potential that Houston will be moving towards being a rebuilding team, right about the time Morey's contract is expiring. There would be a window where it would make sense to leave.

And I would think Tilman realizes that Morey is fucking good at his job (it's possible he doesn't but Tilman comes off as someone who has followed the Rockets closely for the past 20 years) and that if Morey leaves in 5 years (probably dragging some of the better front office talent with him to his new team), Tilman would undoubtedly be the top reason why... and Rockets fans would revolt against him because he pushed Morey away. 

And Morey is still not even 50 years old yet. He has a good 20 years where he'll probably be a top GM in the league. And if that winds up being for another team other than Houston, that's a disaster situation.",rockets

Morey himself should not delete his tweet if he truly believes in what he believes right? 

As a Chinese who lives in the US for more than 10 years. I personally don't like to talk about political stuff to Americans. But Hongkong's situation is more complicated than what most western elites think it is. human rights and self-determination? what a joke.",rockets

Morey is a very public face on social media and other media for the Rockets so him taking a side on a issue like this is a bad move. It is similar to the Kaepernick situation but he has a whole mess of overly passionate folk from another very profitable market that will be taking aim at him without the support from that market to cancel it out. Tillman is just putting necessary distance between the tweet and the organization. Any reasonable business person would either have done it or have someone else do it.

Short of Morey doing something crazy like Antonio Brown, or the team imploding he isn't getting fired. Trolls either run out of steam or get drown out so it isn't too worrying.",rockets

"Honestly surprised Morey decided to tweet that to begin with. He’s a very smart/calculated guy so he had to have known this backlash would be coming - in a huge market for us (2nd biggest?). This must be Morey firmly believing that some things are bigger than basketball/money/dream job and willing to risk all of that to take a stance.

FYI: I have basically zero knowledge of the Hong Kong/China political situation",rockets

Even if I'm pulling the BS ""both sides"" for authoritarians, the way to handle it would be privately, getting Morey to delete the tweet and then sending out an official statement with the bullshit pandering to save the bottom line.

If you have to do a tweet, you could've just done this:

I live in the US now. but I go to China for at least 3 months per year.  I believe I know china more than 99% of people in r/rockets. HK situation might start with good reasons, very good reasons indeed, for western mainstream media. But the fact is, in has involved to a stage that most protesters left now do not hold the same opinion with whoever starts it. 

its okay to downvote me because all things seem unrelated to the rockets org, I understand people are mad at Chinese fans. But as i said, it should have been better if Morey didnt say it in public. If he didn't delete his tweet, I probably would respect his freedom to speech better. Now it seems like the rockets org and morey himself all agree this is a bad choice.

to give a small example, I don't think you ever will see footage like this in western mainstream media. As there exist people who start the act with good reason, now most Chinese AND Hong Kong citizens feel it is over the limit.

"https://youtu.be/BLc8__5HeiU

This is what’s happening right now. An unedited raw video taken by a rioter. 
Students in HK have been in rage mode for months. They carried metal pipes, hammer (heard the metal sound at beginning?) etc, and seeked out police officers and found one. A dozen of guys chased and knocked down the officer and started beating him while he’s on the ground with whatever they were carrying.
A handful of other officers came to his rescue. One of them pointed the gun at rioters and asked them to stop, then one of the rioters charged towards the officer and swung his weapon at the officer and the gun went off, I think hitting the rioter’s arm. (Better shown in an alternative angle in an CNN video, but they crop out anything doesn’t serve their agenda and call it news.)

Tell me what officers in Texas would do when 5-10 guys went at 1 officer like that? 

Police officers in HK did hurt some civilians, but most of the time it’s the civilians who kept pushing them to the edge.

I’m not trying to go political here, I think HK ppl should have the right to their freedom, but I don’t think burning banks, subway stations etc, is the way. I don’t think violence is the answer.",rockets

I’m of the opinion that they shouldn’t be seeking and attacking another person just because he’s a cop. Violence is not the way. 

In the states people who directly attack officers are often shot on site. Again I don’t want anyone to be shot. Don’t push it!

I just want the violence to stop before anybody gets killed.",rockets
"It's not ""for some reason."" This is as big a hot button topic in China as anything in years and Morey stepped into a major landmine. This is equivalent of saying Taiwan should be independent.

If you think he's getting attacked badly on twitter, the Chinese basketball forums are much worse and bigger in scale. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rockets take a major financial hit in China because of this. Thankfully Les is no longer the owner so the team ties to China is a lot looser these days",rockets

Looks like 190.",rockets
"Nah I still see morons saying it lol, it should be so 2016 but it ain’t smh",rockets
"Clemons seems like the real deal. His stroke is so pure, the arc he gets on the ball is insane, can finish difficult layups with both hands. Even his ridiculous halfcourt heave just almost went in, his touch is ridiculous. Love that guy.",rockets
It was fun watching Beard go to work but he should probably rest the second half,rockets
Thank you for this. ✊🏽,rockets
He a big boy !,rockets
I'm loving the pace. Harden and Westbrook are elite transition playmakers. We need to run.,rockets
He is finally in a system that fits his game... 3’s and layups galore !,rockets
Going by last game he played just a couple of mins and then rested. I wouldn't even risk that tbh.,rockets
"him, chandler and clemons are all looking good, thabo a bit too",rockets

Woooo,rockets
[removed],rockets
"He didn’t go on a racist ostracizing tangent that should of ended up with that guy in prison, but he was complaining about every single step James Harden made and something about how “that move wouldn’t be possible when the boys are playing”, I don’t know what boys he was referring to.",rockets

"yeah -- lack of engagement and focus.  He played like he was lost.  If he does not realize his opportunity is winding down he needs to pay attention to Clemons and McLemore, refer to Bennett with his unfortunate and ill-timed injury to dig really deep down to understand that you've only got finite number of shots regardless of MDA and Daryl's raving reviews of him.  Wake up Hartenstein!  Clint, Trezz,... you can be another one!",rockets
Nice shot,rockets
This sub is great. Full of awesome people,rockets
Reminds me of that time we blew them out in LA towards the end of last szn and that one guy was going on and on about his hate for Harden lol,rockets
I like Zach.  What is this?  LOL @ Tilman dig.,rockets
Nah. Paul was good too; they just had creative differences at the end.,rockets
[removed],rockets
"Zach Lowe is usually a media member I have high respect for, but having the Jazz ahead of the Rockets is dumb af. We bodied the Jazz last year. They were no match and I know they added Conley, but that’s not gonna make them that much better. We will beat them in 6 games instead of 5. There’s a arguments for the other teams though even though I think we are number 1. 

Zach Lowe has lost me recently with the Jazz take and saying Harden isn’t a top 3 player",rockets
Dude has a lightning quick release,rockets
I'm not scared of Conley as much as I am Bojan. That dude can play,rockets
Word gotta add some to the closet for sure.,rockets
Don't forget the king in the fourth.,rockets
Of course I think Paul was good and took us far because of the player he is but I just think harden and Russ are better friends,rockets
Yes -- Lowe is the only one that really gives insightful takes for me at ESPN. We'll see how the new crop pans out.  But Lowe's take on the Rockets has been lukewarm at best.  Even the Jazz's addition of the Bogdanovic is not significant enough.  Maybe I'm overrating our wing situation or he could be underrating it or maybe it's somewhere in the middle but I feel that we've gotten much better outside of the CP3-Russ silo trade.  We will see.  Last night was hard to tell where the role players for the Clippers were in relevance to ours since Clint and Harden were doing their thing which skews any comparison and the coaches were strategized differently (Doc not likely driven to win -- I don't think MDA was either but Harden loves to hoop!).,rockets
Yeah -- and his brother is an assassin.  Would love to have his brother on this team just draining silky treys.,rockets
Clearly  a bit of hyperbole but I agree 100 %. If we get off to another slow start I could see him firing MDA or overriding morey and forcing a move that Daryl wouldn't have made. He seems somewhat reactionary imo,rockets
I don't think they're actually brothers lol,rockets
"Thank you Knicks fan, very cool.",rockets
f m l.  you're right.  The heck was planted on me?  I was convinced they were related somehow.  Terrible of me.  lol,rockets
"Well, are you a real fan?",rockets
Zach Lowe is a fuckhead who always ALWAYS underrates Russ. Don't give him your clicks.,rockets
"Wouldn't call it a massive upgrade at the pg position, but hopefully a massive upgrade in terms of keeping harden fresh. Plus their insane chemistry will only rub off to the rest of the team",rockets
Not to mention. They’re essentially some knock off NBA merch. I’m pretty sure Nike do some standard ass shorts for well under $100 that are the same material or thereabouts.,rockets
"I think it is. I think Westbrook is really, really good and he’s gonna shine in a system like you guys run.",rockets
"Thanks Knicks bro, maybe we'll all love to see the day Dolan sells the Knicks, or ""Donald sterling's"" himself.",rockets
"If this Houston team is the same as the team that took the GSW to WCF, but now they have Russ, arguably more depth, and no more GSW + Klay/KD, then I mean.......???",rockets
"LOL -- I really think he's usually objective and insightful and brings something different to the table than others that just speak their mind without making complete considerations.  He also walks you through his thought process and self-deprecatingly makes admits when he is wrong.  I think Russ will excel this season and he will ease off and support it by providing context to how he got from where he was to where he is (then -- hopefully).  idk... I guess it's because I compare him to the other ""f-heads"" that work at ESPN or are constantly on the tube.  Anyways, I'll ease off lol -- I sense there is a deeper perspective here on Zach underrating Russ which I respect your perspective.  Two of the top tier polarizing players on one team!",rockets
Agreed.,rockets

"Bro you sound like a no nothing fan boy. Harden is a phenomenal player the best scorer of his generation and on pace to be the best combination of volume and efficient scoring ever. I am not taking anything away from him. If you can’t look at Giannis and see that he has that his physical tools are the best in NBA history then I’m sorry, you are a idiot. He is a super mobile 7 footer that, while raw as hell, is going to give him certain advantages that players like harden can never have. James harden is more skilled of course. His step back is money but it is still ,league wide, a inefficient shot and if it drops by a few percentage points for any reason it’s value is neutered. The value of a Giannis drive to the rim will always have a floor that will be similar to a harden iso but Giannis will be bigger/faster/stronger until he’s 33 years old. That’s the caliber of athlete he is. Harden is not that caliber of athlete and in the NBA physicals matter. The point being that harden already scores with a degree of difficulty that (while he is very good at doing) will never be the case for Giannis. Giannis will be have the advantage on any player in front of him for every possession for the rest of his career. Can James bridge the gap in skill? Maybe that remains to be seen but the degree of difficulty in closing that gap in athleticism is going to be harder than it would be for Giannis to close the gap in skill. As for harden not exploiting the rules that’s laughable. No one who is a close follower of the game agrees with you: not executives, not analysts, not statisticians, not players, not coaches, and not NBA fans. That’s no knock on him he has a great strategy in a game that’s built on strategy.  And btw the east projects as the weaker conference for the next 5 years. 
TL;DR you can’t teach athleticism but you can teach , at least to some degree, a step back.",rockets

Until you realise that defense is the half and equal part of the game you will never understand why Harden didn't get the MVP.  Also for Harden to have these stats he end up to have the second most usage rate in the history of the NBA. It's easy to just look the numbers but you have to see and how he did it.,rockets

Usage rate is a dumb thing to judge him for imo, CP3 was injured so much last year, and our next best ball handler is Austin Rivers who we picked up later in the season. As you said, context matters.",rockets
"That's a travel

Sincerely r/nba",rockets
"He is still a bad defender tho and Giannis was almost DPOY last season, to see the difference. And no you are wrong about usage rate, it makes senses someone to have huge numbers when in every play the ball is in his hands. These things matters.. 
The way someone accomplish something it really matters when you want to see who is the better player.",rockets
usually the more shots you take the lower your shot efficiency. i don't know exactly how shot efficiency and conversion rate are different but harden had around or i think possibly over 2 points per possession or something at a point last season. i know it was pretty ridiculous,rockets

"Don't forget Rivers.

"I'm not against new ideas, but they need some good ones (like the stros edit).",rockets
"I'd definitely like to see it, but what could the rest rotation be? Are you taking someone out after 3 or 4 minutes? Because if you have 3 different rest rotations,  and none can be concurrent,  then either one person gets a really late one, or they get a really early short one and then a later one.

Makes Eric off the bench seem like a good idea,  but all indications are they're planning to start him.",rockets
"I'd sort of keep Eric's minutes with Russ (for the shooting), bringing the two of them out around the 6 or 7 minute mark for House and Rivers (playing with Harden, PJ, and Capela). Then they can come back either at the tail end of the first or beginning of the second depending upon how long Harden wants to play.

Thabo (good chemistry with Russ) comes in for PJ a bit later... probably around the time Harden sits, too. 

Obviously Chandler will not play every game, but when we have matchups where we need his big body/defense, he'll likely be in for Clint a little earlier than when PJ and Harden come out (8-9 min mark?) Ideally, Hartenstein will be able to step up and play some center when Russ is running solo (Ryno or even Clark would also work as a small-ball option) because then we can just play everyone out beyond the arc.",rockets
Best case is definitely someone stepping up and proving to be worth starting at the 3. My guess would be is that Russ gets a quick pull like Chris did. That way when we bring him back he's facing off against the opponent's 2nd unit where he will feast.,rockets
"yeah - I agree. There were some other good concepts on this sub before as well.  Wish they would consider certain fan submitted ideas.

I actually used to have it but never needed it so I downgraded lol. But thats too much work real talk, and I dont like asking people for that personal type of shit. Plus I would have access to their whole internet/home security/tv/phone provider account(xfinity does all of em at least) that has financial info too, you know what I mean? All I know is I would never give my login info to anybody except my brother, which I've done already, so I wouldn't expect the same for me.

My thing is I pay for xfinity so I feel like this is a AT&amp;T Sportsnet and/or Rox leadership being cheap issue more than anything else. Or maybe I'm missing out on something in regards to some expert level CBA contract TV rights/negotiations shit, that the fans aren't privy to. Maybe thats why the Rox wont send Craig(Im assuming Bill aint tryna to go overseas lmao) and Bull over to Hawaii and Japan.

The clippers are sending Fox sports West out there(thats how NBA TV is broadcasting it) and the raps are sending their [SportsNet/SNE crew to Japan](https://www.nba.com/games/20191008/HOUTOR#/matchup). Theres [even proof on the toronto Sportnet website with the SN logo right there](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/scores/2019-10-08).  

Like I said the rox will give us a FB link tonight, so they're technically accommodating us. But the part that annoys me is a. The past 3 years the FB link info isn't easily available and they don't even drop the link till like an hour at best before the game and b. the links have been hella shitty. So it's not a comparable product at all for what I pay for, which is HD 1080p minimum with the ability to DVR it so I dont have to wake up at 5am lol. Its ridiculous that Id have to pay for, pirate, or ask somebody for a NBA TV login just to have access to 3 preseason games(one of which Russ is debuting). I wont need NBA TV the rest of the year at all 100%. Thats wild to me.

Yes its the preseason and Im bitching like a mf rn, so who cares, but as a consumer I'm not getting the same value as a clippers or raptors fan for the next 3 games. On top of that, I cant even DVR the damn game lmao, so you have to watch it live, on a shitty FB link, that wont drop till 11:30pm CT today or until like 4amCT for next week.

"I believe in him but we had such a small sample size last year that I hope all that work he put in during the off-season coupled with mentorship from Harden, Russ, and Thabo (for his position specifically) helps him become that person.  He’s getting paid to play the role so I hope he lives up to and exceeds his contract and hope that if make it deep and/or win the championship this season then that adds to his veteran experience going forward making him smarter on the BBIQ side like many other valuable veterans out there.  

He shows flashes but needs to be consistent.  Part of it is BBIQ.  He needs to do whatever if asked of him there and study film on his own and show self-direction to be great.

He seems to have a good head on his shoulder and represents H-Town so it would be a great feel good story.",rockets

I guess in aggregate we did get a good look at him.  I was just thinking in terms of an extended run which the contract situation prevented us from getting.  We haven’t seen a full regular season out of him but we did benefit from that in that we were able to afford him in the contract that we offered rather than having to bump it up significantly like we would have had if he had played a full season and performed the way he had for us last season consistently.

"So much to unpack here!

1) Ever heard of paragraphs?

&gt; Harden is a phenomenal player the best scorer of his generation and on pace to be the best combination of volume and efficient scoring ever.

2) This alone is a reason why he is ahead of Giannis. He has already proven that he is a generational talent with actual performances. Giannis has proven it in **1 season**.

&gt; If you can’t look at Giannis and see that he has that his physical tools are the best in NBA history then I’m sorry, you are a idiot.

3) Wait, you really think Giannis' physical tools are the ""best in **NBA history**""? Wow. And you call me a ""no"" nothing (it's supposed to be know, btw) fanboy. Lmao.

&gt; He is a super mobile 7 footer that, while raw as hell, is going to give him certain advantages that players like harden can never have.

4) Uh, yeah, height. NBA is still a game of skill, not raw athleticism. Which is why Giannis got shut down several times in the playoffs by players who were less athletic than him. He will need to develop that skill to actually maximize his physical gifts. And it's not a given that he's going to do that.

&gt; His step back is money but it is still ,league wide, a inefficient shot and if it drops by a few percentage points for any reason it’s value is neutered.

5) How does it matter if it is a league-wide inefficient shot if it is efficient for him? Do you also think Curry's 3 point shot is not as valuable as Giannis' athleticism because it is a leaguewide more inefficient shot than a dunk and thus if it drops by a few percentage points, it's value is neutered?

&gt; The value of a Giannis drive to the rim will always have a floor that will be similar to a harden iso but Giannis will be bigger/faster/stronger until he’s 33 years old.

6) The blueprint to stop Giannis is already out there. Just stop him from driving and make him shoot. Until he has a working shot (i.e. skill), his ability to get to the rim will become harder and harder.

&gt; Can James bridge the gap with skill?

7) He already has.

&gt; Maybe that remains to be seen but the degree of difficulty in closing that gap in athleticism is going to be harder than it would be for Giannis to close the gap in skill.

8) This is such a bullshit assumption. You're literally saying that the decades of hard work that Harden has put in to become one of the best offensive players of his generation will be bridged by Giannis within the next 9 years (of his so-called prime)?

&gt; As for harden not exploiting the rules that’s laughable.

9) You said he ""relied on exploitation of rules"". That is what is laughable. Harden would be unguardable even if the rules were tweaked to allow defenders to take up his landing space and to hand-check and reach. Similarly, Giannis' ability to get to the rim would also be affected if refs actually called his off-arm push an offensive foul.

&gt; And btw the east projects as the weaker conference for the next 5 years.

10) The West has always been the tougher conference and despite this Giannis still has 0 Finals appearances. I don't see them getting past Philly this year and if KD comes back at even 75% of his previous strength, they're going to get dispatched by the Nets.

&gt; TL;DR you can’t teach athleticism but you can teach , at least to some degree, a step back.

11) Maybe Giannis should learn how to shoot normal pull up shots at efficiency before attempting something that is clearly out of his skill range right now.

---

My argument, which you completely ignore, is that Harden has already put together half a decade worth of great, MVP-worthy seasons. Giannis has 1. Harden's first MVP worthy season was at age 25 and Giannis' was at age 24. So it's not like Giannis is miles ahead of Harden in terms of potential.

To just assume Giannis will keep improving at the rate that Harden improved is insulting to Harden. Literally every year analysts think that Harden has been figured out or relies on something that cannot be repeated and every year he comes back with an even better season than the last.

If Giannis can have another dominant, MVP-worthy season we can talk again. But until then, Harden is clearly ahead because he actually has the results on the board.",rockets

So, he's had some tough playoff moments.

"The one thing is he needs to shoot better. His stats on rockets were amazing but if you look at his nba career outside of the 20ish games last year for us aren’t very good. 

I thought that wasn’t a huge deal but then looked at his g league stats, his 3 point percentage was not good in the g league. It has at high volume, but I remember guys like Troy Daniels Canaan and rob covington took higher volume in the g league and still shot very good percentages. It could just be a coincidence or not but, if he can continue his high effort defense, and shoot around 37% at the 3 point while being a 80ish free throw.

And even if he does believe his play is worth that much, he for a fact knows that signing for less would make it 100% easier to win, which he has said on many occasions that he wants to win.

Steph gon be coming in hawtt",rockets
I never thought the day I would see Russ playing off the ball with cuts and screens. Houston going to be dangerous with ball movement and even more dangerous wit Russ and Harden buying in.,rockets
The thing with Curry is that theres no klay to take off defensive responsibilities for him so its going to be consuming his energy having to guard the other top guards in the game. And I dont expect them to be a high enough seed so I doubt he wins MVP even if he somehow averages close to 30 ppg which I dont think he can tbh consistently with defenses going to garner to attempt to stop him mainly.,rockets
#KILLHITLER!!!,rockets
"That’s a good point, getting d-Lo does help relieve some of that pressure, but he’s no where near the lock down defender that klay is. It’ll be interesting to see where they do finish. They still got Steve Kerr’s system which very pass and move orientated to find the best shot, which allows almost anyone to score with a high % shot. Along with Curry’s vision, he can do more than just score to win the mvp. Just has to keep his body fit, he’s had some reoccurring injuries also",rockets
We never even sniffed the 2nd round with him and the year we had a chance to make some noise he decided his body was going to break down,rockets
I've had that same thought but with the Oscars,rockets

If James made his last free throw, we could call it a robbery... As it is, it's just sad; but it reflects on how we let too many winnable games get away from us (that NO game was absolutely unforgivable... Along with many others) and it just barely took him out of the conversation.

"Hell no. He was my favorite player as a kid, but in hindsight, three all star seasons, two all-NBA thirds and one All-NBA second isn’t enough to get your number retired. On top of that, he was a literal chucker in the playoffs for us, we did better without him in 09, and the way he left leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Every other player who’s number we retired did more. Hakeem is our GOAT, Mose Malone won 2 MVPs and brought us to the Finals, Calvin Murphy played his whole career as a Rocket, Rudy T almost died on the court for us and led us to 2 championships as head coach, and Yao Ming helped explode our fan base to an astronomical amount. What has T-Mac done for the Rockets besides be a disappointment?",rockets

"Giannis improved a whopping 0.8 points. 2.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists. Difference between him last year and this year was the rest of his team and coach bud

Meanwhile Harden was playing with a crippled rockets team, averaged 40 for half the season and went from his average to the highest we've seen in decades. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is MVP a team award or a individual award?

There just needs to be a more defined answer to what makes an MVP. Making History? Being best player on the best team? But would anyone on the warriors would have won MVP last year with their stacked roster if they finished first? People even said having KD and Curry on the same team lessens their chances at winning MVP. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is what it is. Media found their new prince child. Congrats Giannis.",rockets

Dang it’s as if HARDEN watched the Kawhi clip and might have intrigued the idea of not putting that third step down hence a one-legged shot!  I’m sure he thought of it from another source but I can see it clearly based on Kawhi’s example of the benefit and how it can be perceived as a travel but it is not. Harden god mode unlocked!,rockets
Clyde also gets points for being a native Houstonian and being part of phi slamma jamma at U of H. If not for those things I’m not sure he’d get his jersey retired by us.,rockets

The $$ spent is Def worth the headache of dealing with illegal streams. Plus the quality distracts me half the time anyways. Most the time I watch the game after live broadcast anyways.,rockets

I just purchased a sh!t ton of jerseys (throwback Harden, icon Russ, association Rivers, and not to mention a random Hakeem practice jersey) so I have to procure a subscription through wifey lol.  I’m putting together my business case for this need in my life and contemplating all of her points about how this takes away from our time or quality time with family (my daughter watches with me! So ha— I’m ready!).  What kind of plan were you thinking of?  A group buy and sharing of an account?  Or having one account and mirroring (idk the term).

lol i like how fancy james is then russ is like naw ima just pull up,rockets
I'm starting to wonder if the majority of the media that covers basketball even watches it or if they just get a list of questions from their editors designed to elicit soundbites.,rockets
"Lol, we need each to play to their strengths.  Haha, have you seen the Russ training videos?  They’re a bit long but you can see the dates printed on the screen and he just got smoother with his shot and off-ball movement as the days went by.  It looks like he’s practicing with a bunch of lacrosse players that are good with the stick trying to smack the ball away.  I hope it translates but realistically he’ll need to get real reps in real game action.  Can’t wait for the games in Japan!",rockets
Its because russ and harden are two of the most polarizing players to ever play the game it comes with the territory tbh considering the media isnt very fond of them overall also.,rockets
And they have the reactions and responses we should really value because they’re looking at the film deeply and studying up on the team unlike the casuals and some of the media that are spread too thin to focus on the Rockets.

"Harden is 100% gonna be one of those greats that gets shit on and then a few years later everyone will say oh shit that guy really was special. Everyone moves to goalposts so hard on him

Last year everyone said they'd give him their MVP vote if he did one thing and then when he did it they shifted it to something else. First it was get Houston HCA, then 50+ wins, then surpass Kobe's 35 PPG, then it was ball out in the playoffs. Then he did all that but apoarently it wasnt enough.

 Idk how a guy who averaged 36/6/7 on a 50+ win team as the only All star in an elite conference doesnt win MVP but whatever",rockets
"I've had the full league pass for 5 years and never had an issue. Can't watch Spurs games, so when the rockets play them you're screwed.",rockets

Well teams were already afraid of the Rockets last year as the Rockets were really the only team GSW respected and wanted to beat out of the West.  Westbrook really does give us a different dimension of attacking the rim in transition that we really didn't have outside of Harden going coast to coast or Capela's rim running. But Harden did not have the energy to do that every possession and CP3 did not have the footspeed to be outrunning guys.  I'm excited to see the variety of offense that inserting Westbrook allows us.,rockets
"Wait, where are these videos?",rockets

Because he picked the Lakers to beat the Rockets when he was still on the roster,rockets
BRING HIM HOME!!!,rockets
"If Russ can hit the 3 at 35% or whatever league average is, he's going to be so useful. I think if he becomes cool playing off ball and playing defense (don't forget advanced def stats loved Russ last season), Rockets will be hella dangerous. 

And if Russ keeps on passing, James Harden is winning MVP.",rockets

"I honestly feel for Giannis because his potentially first MVP season is marred by obvious media bias. He looked so damn uncomfortable having to deflect after winning the award what was obvious. The NBA needs 'new' blood as it's stars age out of the league, of all the younger guys Giannis was the best and his team got the most success.

"It’s just the way it is. Nobody here has said Giannis didn’t deserve his MVP, we just think Harden deserved it more. Had Harden won and not Giannis, this would be the other way around. It’s called an opinion, which by nature is subjective and we support our guy. Same thing happened when it was Harden vs Westbrook for MVP",rockets
**There’s no hate for Giannis**. It is just a combination of the love for the Beard combined with the lived-through appreciation of what he did game-by-game at a micro-level versus what the media was saying is going on at the macro-level (to be fair I didn’t watch much Bucks’ games).   The criteria used as the primary driver was wins in which ironically the Russ vs. Harden for MVP year comes to mind where the framework used seemed to have flipped and presumably for narrative. Regardless they were both great and as a Harden/Rockets fan it is unfortunate bc Harden has less years ahead (maybe) than Giannis who will have tons of “opportunities” (hopefully) so that’s where there is a small pain point. Harden was insane last year and so was Giannis so there was never going to be a unanimous and certain closure on this.  Only time will tell on which season was more memorable.,rockets
"I agree putting /s is wack and ruins the joke. I would go as far as to not even mention MJ (which seems added to ensure it was known you were joking) 

 It’s funnier to just leave it at scrub

HARDENS MY MVB",rockets
Giannis doesnt have that... what's the word... SWAG,rockets
The league wasn’t ready for January James,rockets
cause its hard to get any power from up there,rockets
"Okay so from my perspective. James harden had the best offensive season in history and it’s not even particularly close. Giannis has greater 2 way impact but ultimately didn’t even have a top ten offensive season of the past decade. The MAIN problem hear is the elephant in the room. Giannis is going to go down (barring injury) as a top 10 player all time he’s just that good. He passes the eye test in a way that I’ve personally never seen from a prospect before. He is the perfect athletic specimen and is only scratching the surface. The point is that Giannis will have his time, and he will have a lot of it. Over the next decade he will compete for titles, win imo multiple MVPs, DPoYs etc. We witnessed something that was so far and away a outlier in a analytics sense that having Giannis as mvp seems premature seeing as we may look back on this season from him as a bottom 5 season of his career. To say James harden should’ve won mvp this year is not to say he’s better than Giannis just that he was better this year and it detracts from harden’s case to be a top 10 all time great when Giannis may as well be penciled in at this point.",rockets

"Very well said, couldn’t agree more. There were so many ups and downs, games where it was on full display how great he was going toe to toe with the fully healthy GSW squad and coming out with that crazy buzzer beating deep three. 

And games where it wasn’t nationally televised like the Grizzlies game where he did all he could and had 57 total and like 30 points the last 5 min of the 4th and OT but came away with a loss.  But throughout it all, the Beard fought tooth and nail to keep Houston afloat through an insane western conference. A season that rocket fans will cherish more than anyone else could.",rockets

Giannis has a blow job bell.,rockets
"Disagree on a few points. 

I don't know if we can pencil Giannis in as a top 10 all time player right now. Develop the 3, open up his mid range game, and put up a few more years with ridiculous numbers then yes. 

I really hate the argument of Giannis is young and will get MVPs in the future. That shouldn't factor into the MVP vote at all. Just pick the better, or I guess more valuable, player.",rockets

10) Dunk

9) Block

8) Running dunk

7) Steal then dunk

6) Dunk over a guy

5) Dunk

4) Dunk

3) Spinning layup

2) Dunk

1) Stepback buzzer beater (from about 6 ft away)

I guess we're spoiled since Harden does this kind of stuff in his sleep while having 10ppg more each season. What exactly makes Giannis special besides the fact that he's likeable, fast and has long arms? Why does everyone act like he's going to be a Top 10 player ever?",rockets

Yeah it’s pretty sad lol,rockets
I didn’t say that I said Giannis will be top 10 all time. This doesn’t mean harden won’t. Giannis path to top 10 is so much clearer than harden’s however. He just has to play ball and win chips.

Claiming that Harden has to rely on rule exploitation tells me all I need to know about your understanding of the game. And yeah, it's an inefficient shot for most anyone except Harden. That's what makes it great.

Seriously your argument is like saying Steph Curry relied on a deep three during his unanimous MVP year which was an inefficient shot. Yeah no shit, because he's really fucking good at it and better than anyone else.

Giannis meanwhile has had 1 great season and is unlikely to come out of the East any time soon. Somehow he's a lock for chips? Lmao.",rockets

He's been a top player in the league and is still a very serviceable point guard. To imply that he only deserves a minimum is an insult. They wrote him that contract because he wouldn't take anything less as a 9 time all Star that was still averaging 18/5/9/2 the season before he came to Houston that's still one of the best playmakers in the league.",rockets

"You're being purposefully obtuse if you can't see how saying that he can't wait to go into the post season with a real killer after going into the post season with CP3 the past two years is straight up saying that Chris isn't a real killer despite averaging 21/6/6 his first year in the playoffs with the Rockets and 17/6/5.5 the next with two steals to go along with it each year. 

The dog part is talking about determination, which means he think Chris didn't really try hard enough and the killer part obviously is saying that he doesn't think Chris is about to dominate games, which is pretty ridiculous with some of the statlines he has put up. 

You're just stupid, if you can't see that CP3 is acting professionally while there has been a lot of shade thrown his way. I don't know about before the trade but there is no doubt any longer that Harden helped facilitate the trade for Russ, so he definitely is the reason CP3 is gone, so saying otherwise is ridiculous. I never said he was forcing him out before the trade because I thought everything was overblown but every comment about obtaining Russ has either been ill worded OR they're intentionally wording them in an effort to put blame on Chris. 

Stop trying to put a twist to the insults that Harden and Tilman have aimed at Chris. Everybody has faults but that doesn't mean they need to shunt blame for the last two seasons to Paul.

Let’s not forget the reason Chris is gone is because Harden wanted Russ but also he was burned out on Chris.

You can't talk about your new washer being able to fit all your clothes in the same load if your last washer was already able to do that.

"he doesn't deserve a minimum, he got a contract he deserves. him taking a minimum would be a cap favor. his contract was a hard to move contract just like westbrook's is. it's not just how good the player is or isn't perceived as, the contract itself does matter in that regard. even a contract like harden's is a hard to move contract, a team would have to gut itself to make a trade like that. and cp3 couldn't take a short changed contract because he was in the midst of making a point for the players, because stars taking less then they are worth was being an issue and the PA have beeb fighting against it being necessary. i don't know if he personally would have taken a smaller deal if they could have still got russ and there was no pressure from the public or PA. but he did get a contract he deserved, but it came with other repercussions. and his heart and dedication has not been questioned by anyone in houston, and i haven't heard that in the media either. his age and body breaking down have been the only real concerns about cp3 and then people in the media overblown his demeanor in a negative way. everyone involved still seems to maintain that has nothing to do with it. harden reportedly wanted russ on his team for years before cp3 even got there, so that didn't have anything to do with it either considering he also wanted cp3 there too. i really believe if the cap was unlimited and they could make moves while paying everyone they would absolutely love to have cp3 still on the rockets. they would have probably had to trade eric gordon+ if that were the case though. just to get the russ trade approved.",rockets
"Injuries among good players are common lately and very rarely considered when contact time comes. Kyrie, Blake, Wall, KD, Boogie, and more. Chris Paul is historically impactful. It sucked for Houston when he got injured and I can understand trading him.

The subtle and not-so-subtle shade being thrown into the public arena is just kind of crappy, especially when it's all aimed at Chris currently.

In 1v1’s, Donovan Mitchell mentioned in a podcast episode that CP3 literally has no shot pocket so seems like Harden worked some of that into his repertoire.  I’m just speculating of course.

🔥 starter,rockets
But will he be?,rockets
"It seems that the sons were raised in the UK and were previously all about soccer; only after Olajuwon felt they should give basketball a serious attempt did he move them back here. The eldest is already 15, so he’s probably fairly behind other kids who are seriously learning. Idk enough about it, but is that young enough to still advance enough to compete against others at the elite HS level?",rockets
"You can, but it doesn't really bother me all that much. Plus I can take it to an upholstery shop and have it removed if I ever feel the need. Pretty sure the only way to preorder it was from rocketsshop.com and any official team site always has the patch on them.",rockets
That first one is 🔥🔥,rockets
"You’re right.  That’s a big if for both Ryno and Hartenstein.  There’s literally nothing else for Hartenstein to prove in the G-League besides shore up BBIQ but he will never make the leap if he stays with inferior competition.  He won G-League Finals MVP and put up absurd numbers on both ends of the floor while consistently knocking down 3-pointers.  Him making a leap would depend on opportunities such as last year when we were super limited that he had to guard KD in an early regular season game and showed glimpses of how valuable he could be by being defensively attuned to the switching scheme and giving KD some resistance on the perimeter.  However, he fell out of the rotation and spent way too much time away to be effective when he was asked to come back at the end of the G-League season.  This season is now or never for him on the Rockets and he would probably do better on another team with opportunities rather than a contender if he doesn’t immediately contribute. 

Ryno is a feel-good gamble.  You’d love to see him turn back the clock but he didn’t look great after falling out of the starting line-up with the Suns early last season and then completely out of rotation with the Heat that just didn’t have a need for him.",rockets
All these made threes and I can’t make a single damn open three with him in 2k20.,rockets

That last shot was super big brain. Watched the highlights from the other night and thought everyone was throwing weird lob passes that looked like shots. BUT then you see this and now Harden putting up shots the look like lobs. WFT is going on?!?!?!,rockets

"We clearly still need to replace the Ariza/Luc role more competently.

Aside from PJ, our actual rotation at forward (to cover 96 minutes in 82 games) consists of unproven youth (House, Clark, Hartenstein) and vet-min signings (Thabo, Ryno, Bennett).

Running 3-guard lineups didn't work against the Dubs or Bucks last year... We need size to get boards and defend big contenders like LA and Philly.

"RW, JH, EG, PJT, CC

AR, GG, TS, DH, TC 

GC, IH, NH

Those are the guys that have a decent chunk of guaranteed money coming their way, so I suspect they make the roster.

Ryno also has a 250k guarantee, giving him an inside track to a spot (only a great tc from Bennett kicks him out, imo).

That leaves only one spot left.

One of Bennett, McLemore, Frazier, Ponds, Blossingame, Clemons makes it, 2 get 2-ways and 3 go to RGV.

So realistically (by fit/experience), I guess McLemore will get the spot if he shows he can do it.

I'm rooting for Clemons and Bennett to make our 2-way contracts, but mainly cause I know nothing valuable about anyone else.",rockets

Tyson might even contribute with solid minutes in playoff games.",rockets

James looking sharp,rockets
"Interesting points:

- He wants to bounce back from last year, went from vet team to all young team that didn't have an identity, he's glad to be back with a team that has 1 goal and he's familiar with that

- ""This is a group that... I mean what do we lack? That's what it felt like a few years ago. This year there's excitement in the air.""

- Says his job and a lot of other guys job is to space the floor and let harden and russ do their thing (not a fan of this...)

- Tyson adds more than what you see on and off the court, he's a great leader and veteran. Has a knack for offensive rebounding with tapbacks

- Says his journey has been one of many mental struggles, ups and downs, if you know my story you know theres been challenges. last year was a challenge he's never experienced before, but he doesn't wanna complain, says hes learned from it and feels fortunate to be where he is to have a chance to play for houston again.

- Conversations about re-joining began happening months ago(!) with dantoni, and then heated up with morey recently

- In response to a question about not having that huge contract anymore, says its tough being a guy making a lot of money and not playing and getting a lot of minutes, says it was a frustration and definitely a big ego trip, and it got talked alot by the media. Says now, pressures off, and he can enjoy the game again and be a great teammate and the player they want him to be. 


 
I hope he doesn't forget his deadly pump fakes and sneaky post moves!",rockets
"Russ shot alright after the allstar break last year. I wouldn’t be surprised if he shot 35% on the year. (Was 34 after the break)

He also shot 38% from 3 when catch and shoot as opposed to pull ups 31%.

Russ also starts slow when shooting, usually facilitates a lot early on, then gets his rhythm late in games.

In 4th quarters last year (after the ASB, he started hurt) the man shot 47 from the field and 36 from 3. 42% catch and shoot, 47% when open. 

We all know he isn’t a shooter, but in the 4th sometimes it really does look like it. That, plus the system and I dont know if you’ve ever heard of James Harden? You guys are going to be so fucking good next year",rockets
I'm also surprised by the balls on the reporter to straight up ask ryno a question about his contract lol.,rockets
"Getting a 33% 3 pointer is 1 point per possession which is actually better than most half court offenses.

Theres a reason the Rockets jack up so many 3s",rockets
"Pretty sure it resulted in a massive momentum swing too. Can't remember the exact circumstances, but I'm pretty sure the Thunder were only down a little bit at the time and it was late in the game. And then the eventual play we ran out of timeout was terrible.",rockets
I think Russ will play off the ball really well.. but this drill doesn’t prove that in the slightest.,rockets
"Dmo cant even play in the NBA anymore. 

Ryno is the absolute best floor spacing PF in the league when he has someone who can get him open looks. Dude takes 3s from 3 feet behind the arc. Shut yo ass up",rockets
"Hes really one of my favorite role players. Love his attitude. Cant blame him for taking that big ass fuckin check. 

He was made a joke for it but hes still got the shooting abilities.

People say shit about last yesr but he only played like 25 games and took less than 2 3s a game. We had him shoot wide open shots from Harden on 7 attempts and 40%. 

Hes gonna bigly this year",rockets
"I’m so happy he’s back. Sure, he’s not perfect, but what he is good at he’s really good at. Plus, I know he’s not known for his rebounding because he’s usually on the perimeter, but between him, Capela, Chandler, Tucker, and Russ, the Rocket’s rebounding numbers are going to be crazy.",rockets
"If you say so.............  even if you dont  have a clue, atleast have a good night.",rockets
7 seconds or less,rockets
"Tbh as a long time Russ fan, I've never seen him set a screen with his full body like that. It's always a lazy half screen if anything. If nothing else, it proves he can get set into an actual screen position when asked, and also that it might be the type of action the Rockets run this season.",rockets
"Donovan hasn’t even gotten an extension, though. The team just picked up the option on the final year of his contract, because they would rather have him lead the tank then have to pay for a new coach.",rockets
Looking like a sexy t-rex I fucking love it!,rockets
"Lol I’ll chime in as a Thunder fan. Yes, I think we should just play out the contract, don’t renew and find another coach at the end of the contract.",rockets
Hes with the homies and they all actually have personality,rockets

"That makes the most sense to me. You know what you’ll be paying Donovan, but you don’t know(or you do and you don’t want to spend that much) what other coaches will want to come in while the team isn’t likely to be a top ten seed in the West.

Just enjoy the tank for a year and be happy you will have a shot at a better coach to develop the solid young guys you have and the ones you will draft with all those picks from the Clippers and Rockets, as well as whatever you might get in a trade for CP3.",rockets

"Not saying youre wrong but this is the thing lets look at russ's 2017 MVP first. First off it really has never been done he came off a season where KD a top 5 player left for nothing (no sign and trade, nothing) and they still got 47 wins and the 6th seed all because of him. And he did average a 32-10-10 triple double which nobody has ever done. I dont like comparing it to Oscars because the compeition was much much worse back then, less teams, on top of that russ did it with little to no shooting around to him etc... It was something unprecendented people do things with scoring, defense, etc... but I just thought russ revolutionized it with that season. You also have to look at the narrative added, KD leaves then people feel bad for russ so it adds on to him winning the MVP (not saying thats the reason but it adds to it)

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets compare it to James in 2019 yes the scoring is scoring but he did it at an astronomical rate, he carried/willed/whatever he was that spectacular and to this day I still dont know why he didnt win the MVP as it was more deserved over what giannis did. James had a better record compared to Kobes 2005-2006 season, more ppg, more apg, more rpg and yes I do believe Kobe deserved MVP that year also but again its like this people vote for narratives a long with somebody doing the unseen. People get used to scoring so they factor in ""oh what happens if he averages a triple double now""? Nash's mvp was similar to giannis in 2019 where the team had 52+ wins a likeable non polarizing superstar  and with Amare the whole season it was very impressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Well look at the tripld double like this russ has averaged it for the past 2 seasons as well but this past season for instance he was all nba third team instead of second for instance why is that? Its because people get used to stuff like this. On top of that James had just won his MVP in 2018 so the voters may have felt a swing in ""oh this likeable superstar giannis led the bucks to 60 wins, plays all world defense and isnt a polarizing player to watch unlike James so lets give it to him"". Thats how voters view things and I dont like seeing it like that. MVP means Most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically. I defeintly see that more with James in 2015 as opposed to steph. I see that greatly with russ in 2017. I see that greatly with James in 2019 as well.",rockets

"I mean he was worth the price when signed originally, just kinda fell off a bit over the years.  
He was basically at the top of his specialized role for a minute I mean(stretch 4). Ryno's skillset and his ability to keep his defender so far away from the paint was a really valuable asset at the time.",rockets
"&gt;Thats how voters view things and I dont like seeing it like that.

Yeah, but again voters have consistantly voted guys like Giannas (top team in conference but lesser stats) over guys like Harden pretty consistently in the history of the NBA. It would be one thing if the consensus historically was to vote for the Westbrook-esque seasons of great stats but no team success, but it's been the opposite. 

&gt;MVP means Most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically. 

Again, if you look at how people have voted on the award historically, a just as valid argument would be that the MVP is best player on one of the best teams. I think the reason why people have that opinion is because there is this notion that yeah you can have a season like Westbrook did, but then we all knew that they didn't realistically have a shot at winning a title. So how valuable can you be in a ""can you bring your team a championship"" sense if you are almost certainly getting knocked out in the first round.

I'm not saying that your opinion is wrong by any means. It's all just opinions. And personally, I would be fine with them more strictly defining the criteria and/or creating a 2nd award that is more centered on just crazy regular season numbers. But the NBA (probably intentionally) has made the criteria for the award vague because every year people like to argue what they think the MVP means and it drives discussion in the NBA.",rockets

Lots of clips of Russ in the corners. I think we’re gonna run plays to make that his shot this year. For context he shot the most corner 3’s in his career last year at a 36.7% clip. If he’s being set up on those 3’s by Harden I expect that number to rise.,rockets

cp3 didnt even guard the opposing guards or best scorers on the opposing team in fact it was the third primary wing overall that he guarded. Just from all of the analytics russ has been the better defender the past 2 seasons plus his on ball defense has been better for a while now due to his footspeed/athleticism overall.

&amp;#x200B;

We will have those anomaly years though in which something different is done (russ in 2017 and what should have been harden especially in 2019) for instance lets say if (random name) doncic averages 23/10/13 while shooting 50/40/90 and leads the mavs to the 7th seed whereas a guy like jokic averages 22/11 on 47/32/84 and leads the nuggets to the 2nd seed. Voters might feel more inclined to vote for Doncic here as nobody expects the mavs to be in the playoffs tbh let alone the 7th seed on top of that he averages a triple double and goes for a 50/40/90 thats just what i mean by anomaly years.",rockets

Now maybe you make other exceptions for other players. Like... if we find out Westbrook is better fighting through picks... maybe we don't switch with him.

And on the offensive end it's going to be even better because if Harden gets switched onto a PF or C defensively. Then they get a stop and suddenly Harden has a bad matchup on him from the start in transition. It's going to lead to easy scoring opportunities on the other end.

Even more so now that we're going to be running more, it will make it far easier to take advantage of those mismatches that were initially created by letting Harden get switched onto a big.",rockets

Harden couldn’t win it at 4th tied for 3rd and only one game down from 2nd while having better stats than MJ.

Oh man. I didn't even think about the ramifications of Tyson tap backs for our offense. He might get us an extra 3 3pt attempts up a game.

I feel like I saw this when CP3 played here lmao,rockets
Just put Steph and Harden in the 16-18 range.  That sounds about right I think,rockets
"It’s not about changing what you think, the first thing you said was “you don’t know why people here didn’t like Westbrook” I gave you the reason, this is a Houston sub where Harden has been robbed multiple years in a row one of which was one that Westbrook got, I’m not saying it’s law I’m answering your question that’s why people here didn’t like Westbrook.

Imagine if Harden won it last year, you wouldn’t go to their sub and and wonder why they don’t like Harden cause they would think Giannis should have won it, it’s that simple.

And again don’t take this as hate or me saying that it wasn’t close because i would have for sure supported Westbrook if I was an OKC fan. This has been Hardens team and he’s been competing against Westbrook for years of course they will be compared and some people are going to think one is better than the other. Just cause Westbrook is on the team now and I do like him doesn’t mean I’m gonna drop my support for Harden who has been in Houston fo years",rockets

he needs to get off his phone while driving lol i'm legitimately concerned,rockets
"I don't think that's why people are sleeping on Russ and Harden. To me (and presumably real Rockets haters as well) it's all about the fact that he's really inconsistent from the 3 point line. For all of the other pairings that isn't really an issue. 

And the NBA hate train is consistent because the other duo that haters have constantly questioned is the Ben Simmons/Embiid duo, and it's the same idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately 3 point shooting is something that can feasibly be worked on. It wouldn't surprise me if he has a good season shooting the 3 ball. There are a lot of signs pointing to the fact that he can be at least average there.",rockets

I like Austin's humble answers and team-first mentality, but funny is funny.",rockets
"It seems like based on your hypothetical picks for MVP those years, you tend to like voting for the guy that is on a ""less successful"" team but maybe had to face adversity. 

Thing is, if you look at historically how people have voted for the award. They time and time again have voted for the candidate on the better team (even if they didn't have the best scoring season) over the guy with just the raw numbers. Oscar Robertson didn't win MVP when he averaged a triple double. Wilt didn't win it when he averaged 50 and 20 either. Kobe didn't win it when he averaged 35, he actually came in 4th in voting.

And the numbers for bad teams with MVPs on them were very low. It was like less than 3 times in the 60+ year history of the MVP award did it go to a team lower than the 3 seed in their conference.

That's why I was so against a Westbrook MVP. I would've been more of a fan if they consistently voted that way every year. Or if at the very least voted that way more than 3 times in the history of the NBA. But basically just the one time, and the two other times when voting that way would've benefited the Rockets, obviously they went back to their traditional ""voting for the best player on one of the best teams"" criteria.",rockets

"Robert Covington was an undrafted guy when we had him (similar to say Gary Clark). We wound up just straight up cutting him IIRC because he was like the 12th or 13th best player on the team and we needed to make room for him for some reason. 

You can't really fault Houston for not seeing he would become... a servicable starter in the NBA way back then. And it's arguable that he would've developed into that while on the Rockets. He got a good 2 years of 30+ minutes and no pressure to win in Philly.

Marcus Morris is slightly more of a confusing story. We traded him for a 2nd round pick to the Suns. That was also when we acquired Thomas Robinson from the Kings who was a similar situation of young player on a rookie deal at PF. I think there were two reasons why we moved on from him: 

1. We just had a glut of young PFs at the time. Remember, Terrance Jones was also someone we had recently drafted, and I think D'Mo was the same year as well. So if we felt like Marcus Morris wasn't getting the job done, might as well try to recoup his value by trading him for a 2nd rounder. 

2. Specifically why we would want Thomas Robinson as opposed to Marcus Morris. I remember people bringing up that Thomas Robinson's contract was much more tradable. I forget exactly why. It might've just been that it was under rookie control for 1 year longer. So if we needed to unload his contract for nothing (which we wound up doing and getting 2 2nds) we would be able to do that. And cap room wound up playing a big part because thats what led to us being able to sign Dwight Howard in free agency.",rockets

Then again I still think KD’s decision to go to golden state was unfair af but I understood where he could come from after a while of me trying to figure out why aside from the easy championships,rockets

"* One of the only factual statements in the article: ""Players shoot about [four or five percentage points better](https://fansided.com/2016/02/23/introducing-free-throw-splits/) on the second free throw, and somewhere around six to nine percent better on the third shot compared to the first. This makes sense for obvious reasons: Taking a warmup shot or two makes a shot easier. By removing the second and third shot, players would live and die on that first, worse shot. That not only lowers the overall percentage, but consolidates the risk — one miss means no points. This would not only be good for the league, but necessary."" 
* Kyle refers to Harden as ""**annoying**"" and describes opposing minds to be ""**good guys**"":  ""The massive difference between the first and third shot would disproportionately affect some especially **annoying** players. James Harden, who uses the universally loathed stop-and-flail move to [draw more three-shot fouls than any NBA team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-gets-fouled-on-3s-more-than-any-nba-team/), would see the efficiency of those plays plummet. Enough to dissuade him from doing it? Perhaps not. But his reward for playing litigation ball would be lessened, which is a minor win for the **good guys**.""
* Anti-Harden sentiment from Kyle again in referring rule experiment as ""**welcome first step**"": ""That’s where we are today, and the reason Harden is completely in the right to play the way he does. It will take more drastic action than even this experimental rule to change that truth, but implementing it in the NBA would nonetheless be a **welcome first step**.""",rockets

"""While the \[one-legged shot\] doesn’t appear likely to be a very high-percentage one in an actual NBA game, confidence accounts for a lot: The threat is arguably more valuable than the actual effectiveness of the shot. Like Curry’s half-court range, Harden is brandishing a weapon that he knows his defenders know he has—one that previously never had to be factored into a defense’s calculus. It’s just another element to Harden’s unplaceable, purposefully convoluted time signature. And it’s probably not the only one he’s ready to unveil. """,rockets

He's generally played pretty well. The odd San Antonio game is what really haunts him. I think he has matured since then. It's hard for them to accept a simple truth like that.

"* One of the only factual statements in the article: ""Players shoot about [four or five percentage points better](https://fansided.com/2016/02/23/introducing-free-throw-splits/) on the second free throw, and somewhere around six to nine percent better on the third shot compared to the first. This makes sense for obvious reasons: Taking a warmup shot or two makes a shot easier. By removing the second and third shot, players would live and die on that first, worse shot. That not only lowers the overall percentage, but consolidates the risk — one miss means no points. This would not only be good for the league, but necessary.""
* Kyle refers to Harden as ""**annoying**"" and describes opposing minds to be ""**good guys**"":  ""The massive difference between the first and third shot would disproportionately affect some especially **annoying** players. James Harden, who uses the universally loathed stop-and-flail move to [draw more three-shot fouls than any NBA team](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-gets-fouled-on-3s-more-than-any-nba-team/), would see the efficiency of those plays plummet. Enough to dissuade him from doing it? Perhaps not. But his reward for playing litigation ball would be lessened, which is a minor win for the **good guys**.""
* Anti-Harden sentiment from Kyle again in referring rule experiment as ""**welcome first step**"": ""That’s where we are today, and the reason Harden is completely in the right to play the way he does. It will take more drastic action than even this experimental rule to change that truth, but implementing it in the NBA would nonetheless be a **welcome first step**.""

You can never have too many ball handlers. We lost that 2015 run (imo) because we didn’t have a 2nd ball handler. When Harden was out of the game or struggling we had Jason Terry as the PG.  Like if Morey built a team with Westbrook/Harden/ LeBron / Simmons / Jokic would people really say that 1 ball stuff? Talent always finds a way to work together,rockets
"Yeah, that's the one series where IMO you can say he choked. And he's had a few playoff series before then where he's been inefficient. But these last two post season runs he's been pretty good IMO.

I mean... if you really want to be critical you can look at that Utah Jazz series he was held to 28 points and 8 assists on less than 50% EFG. But at the same time, Utah obviously a top defensive team, and oh by the way the series was basically over after game 3 and most of the games were blowouts so it's kind of hard to really critique any result from that series. 

But again, look at the next series against Golden State, 35 a game hitting his normal efficiency. Perfectly fine series for him.",rockets

"538 comes up with some 'weird' stuff, but I find their projections are typically decent. Not sure how the Clippers are so low in their eyes, though. Normalizing their odds knocks some of the luster off the Rockets and Sixers. (to a lesser degree). I'd put our odds a little below 20%, realistically... Favorites in a Finals matchup but only about 40% at best to come out of the West, despite being the  team to beat.

Harden is tough to project, but I'm confident there won't be regression in his game. His numbers may take a hit depending on what kind of schemes we are going to run, but I'd guess 32/5.5/5.5 on his most efficient shooting in years... More than enough to secure his second MVP after we finish in the top seed in the West.",rockets

Steph and Shaq are too high and Robinson in front of Dream does not work for me on any level... (Although Hakeem in front of Kobe is fine)

Astros and Rockets championship in the same season?,rockets
You’re wrong and here’s why. -Stephan A Smith,rockets
Harden has said quiet a few times he wants to retire here and even bought into the Dynamo. I really think he will be here for his whole career unless Fertitta does some stupid shit to piss him off.,rockets
"Kobe won an MVP 2 years after he averaged 35. As long as Harden grabs the first seed and post a BPM &gt; 9.5 and a VORP greater than 8.5, he’ll win the award. I don’t even think Harden really cares about winning more MVPs now though. He’ll probably save most of his juice for the playoffs.",rockets
As a shooter you practice from all areas of the floor. Start close to the basket and then move further out to calibrate the shot,rockets
I fully believe that he wants to retire in Houston. I just don't know that it's the smartest use of him as an asset.,rockets
"While his spending is definitely something I think most of us are at least a little concerned with, I’m still happy he bought the team. At least I know he won’t move the team out of Houston.",rockets
I think we’ll keep him as long as he wants to be here. Hopefully he ends his career here like dirk did in dalass.,rockets
"Sometimes you have to look past market values, sometimes its about beeing grateful for what one has done for a team. We are eventually going to need to tank, i thikn we should stop running away from that thought and accept it. Harden has played his soul out for us and will continue to do so, he deserves a Dirk’esk retirement with us and would be really happy if it happened even if it cost us",rockets
"It looks better to free agents if we look at these guys as more than just assets. That includes fans.

Its a bad look to look at a guy like Harden as an ""asset""  even when he eventually gets to the twilight of his career.",rockets
"Unless he asks for it, there’s no chance Morey trades him",rockets
"It might not be the best thing for the team, but I hope we don't look at him as an ""asset"" as he enters the downward slope after his prime. I want him in Rockets uniform until the day he retires, hopefully with a ring or two along the way. If that delays Houston's ability to rebuild/retool for a couple of years like Kobe's retirement did for the Lakers, so be it.",rockets

I saw Hakeem at 13  (ctrl + f hakeem) and was like oh thats not bad..then saw 12 and realized why this was posted. wow..,rockets
"This list isn't too bad apart from the top 13 lol. There's no universe where Robinson, a top 20 guy himself, is better than Olajuwon. Well, I'm sure there's a universe where Hakeem plays Hockey, but you know what I mean. The author makes a really good case for Durant which honestly no one can argue with, close to 70% TS% in the Finals on 30ppg is untouchable. But regarding Hakeem they seem to have forgotten the same argument of putting his team on his back for a championship (B2B in Hakeem's case) that elevates Dirk in the same article",rockets
What'd you do to nene?!,rockets
"My gut feeling is Daryl morey see his exit on the horizon. The team has no draft equity, no young prospects, and a bunch of soon to be (or already are) bad contracts. He’s trying to win a championship in the next 3 years and if not it won’t be his problem anymore.",rockets

Not sure why this sub keeps forgetting this but Gary Clark is on this team like it or not he’s signed to guaranteed money until 2021. He’s not getting cut or sent to the gleague when there’s several guys on non guaranteed money contracts right now,rockets
"Be careful with that statement. That same argument can be used to put Kobe ahead of LeBron; all the players that went against both of them seem to lean towards Kobe being the better player. Obviously, when looking at on court impact, that isn’t true at all. Honestly, peak Shaq was better than Olajuwon on offense. Olajuwon was probably the best defender of all time though. The way I see it, the two of them were on similar tiers, but I give the slight edge to Shaq because I value offense more. You can have extreme respect for a player and say they were better than you, even if they weren’t. Peak Gary Payton made John Stockton his bitch, but if you listened to Gary Payton, he would tell you Stockton was better than him.",rockets
"He'll get a chance, and with that shot of his, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets decents minutes even if it's garbage time.",rockets

from everything everyone has stated so far it seems they plan to keep harden until he is at least close to the end of his career,rockets

Whoa whoa whoa. Who is saying my guy Geery is going to get cut??!,rockets
"I was actually nodding along with almost all of this until we got the absolute sham of Hakeem 7 spots behind Shaq and 1 behind *David Robinson*. My other big complaint was Elgin Baylor and Moses Malone were each about 10 spots too low.

I actually think the spots they ranked all the modern players were very sane and well-reasoned. I do appreciate them normalizing everything to per-possession stats to put Wilt/Oscar's numbers in a more sane context and highlight how great Harden/Westbrook/Curry are.",rockets

I’d rather have Bennett get cut then Clemons because Chris showed some real skill in the summer,rockets
"It was fun because of the dark days we experienced leading up to that. Kelvin Cato, Shandon Anderson, Mo Taylor, Eddie Griffin, Moochie, Kenny Thomas, Walt Williams, Dan Langhi, etc etc.

Move out of Houston? Are you kidding me? You think the NBA would approve a move out of Houston? One of the largest markets out there? Maybe in the 90s that would have gone down but this is a different era. They were talking about moving the Rockets to Louisville for fcks sake. LMAO. You think that would be an option today?,rockets

Yeah but hindsight is 20/20.,rockets
Replace Clemmons with Clark and that’s probably it. Kinda wanted to see Bennet get some minutes but idk how he cracks into this rotation,rockets
I hope Russ keeps wearing the “ninja” headband even if it’s supposedly banned,rockets

He cracks the rotation by being a good shooter and playing solid defense. His main competition is Ryan Anderson so i do have hope for the kid. Especially on the defensive end,rockets
Prime Hakeem Olajuwon is the greatest center to ever play the game.,rockets
"Oh, I can definitely see that. I’m hopeful for it happening. My main concern is who he replaces in our lineup and how. Our top 15 looks pretty tight aside from Clemmons who has shown he can ball out but I’m not very high on him because of his size. I’m hoping Bennet takes his spot in the lineup",rockets

Have to keep the defense honest.  I think he’s been working on it so the bigger hope is that it is respectable compared to his drop-off in recent years and if it does not fall in the beginning of the season that he adjusts and the team strategy adjusts towards four-man-out-spread offense and he attacks the rim or pulls up for his infamous “cotton shot” that faded recently.

"Not many players take pullup contesed 3s like that lol, you can keep the defense honest in better ways. Russ is not a great off the dribble shooter, let's hope he doesnt take many. His shot attempts should be almost all at the rim or on catch and shoot open 3s if we want to use him well.",rockets
That list is fucking bullshit.,rockets
You make a good point on **contested**.  I absentmindedly forgot that he takes low percentage hero-ball-like shots off the break that do not make sense and doesn’t squeeze the most out of a possession.  I was hoping that the long rebounds is favorable for us but we haven’t been able to rebound effectively last year even without huge proportion of 3 pters.  I hope he senses that but this clip proves your point that he does not see it that way yet unless he’s dropping 40% of them in practice right now after a summer of working on his shot... LOL (holding my breath),rockets

I agree that his role needs to be as a scorer off the bench. His starter days are over. But how does one prove it without getting a shot. 

We’re seeing some shitty G league guys get deals ahead of him. 

I understand that he shouldn’t be on everyone’s radar. But it’s past a joke when the nets sign two nobodies and the Pistons grab joe Johnson yet a fully healthy and In shape first ballot hall of gamer can’t get a job. 

I can understand why Portland don’t want him. As he’d shunned them for a couple years. (He wouldn’t lower himself to play in Portland Cos he was arrogant and entitled) 

But after that. Almost every team bar the top 7-8 teams could use him in a meaningful role. 

I mean shit. Dwight Howard seemed destined to be forgotten and even he got a job.",rockets

"Yeah, this is where the disconnect is though. The original issue with Laura Ingraham saying he should shut up and dribble was that she was saying his feelings on matters that were important to him weren't valid because it wasn't his job to comment on those issues. Lebron isn't saying Morey can't tweet what he wants. He simply stated that Morey was misinformed for tweeting by not understanding the consequences. Which is probably the same thing any one with a PR background would have told Morey which is why Morey deleted the tweet.

Lebron probably doesn't know enough about the issue or isn't invested enough about it. If he says nothing we crucify him for taking a stance on a matter that no one expected any NBA player or coach to take a stance on. I can't help but understand where lebron is coming from. The entire PR shit storm is not something I think the NBA expected to deal with before the season started. They are an international league with plenty invested in international markets. If Morey had taken the time to think of how this affected the entire league, meaning players who didn't know enough about the issue, then I think he would have waited to make a statement that had more clarity and wouldn't catch an entire league off gaurd.",nba

"You know I've never been a LeBron fan. I kinda felt more the way most NFL fans feel about Brady. I respect his amazing career and will give him his due diligence but I'm not really a fan. But this is the first time I've ever disliked him. I understand the man himself is a business, but to willing participate in an Orwellian goverments narrative in order to protect your $ is disgusting for a a man of Lebrons security and influence. There is no reason for him to this other than greed.

What Tsai, Lebron, and the Chinese goverment say is that this an issue of Chinese sovereignty. Though China has not said this their state run media outlets have heavily implied that American Imperialism is the real influence over the protest. 

The Chinese right to Hong Kong is one of the biggest lies you've ever been told. Just because it is the diplomatic position of the worlds countries doesn't mean it was the just right thing to happen. 

I am not defending imperialism. What was done to the Chinese by western powers in the Victorian age was horrible. But Hong Kong was nothing before the British took the island. The global financial hubs a prosperous city and culture was created by the British and a different, free Chinese people. You see decades of separation off peoples creates different cultures. And while unification of a divided people is great in some circumstances, we must also recognize that it should not be forced upon people's who do not want it. The handover of Hong Kong was presented as the symbolic end of imperialism and the overdue unification of the Chinese people. What was hidden from the world by media narratives was that Hong Kong didn't want to become Chinese, and Britain was forced to give the Island to China due to their economic, military, and diplomatic power. The reason they didn't want to be part of China and why the British tried to give them 50 years of Freedom that China is trying to strip away, is that China is totalitarian goverment that will punish people for what they think. Do not let capitalism fool you.  The government behaves like the western image stereotypic image of a communist nation. Read the agreement that China. China was to maintain Hong Kongs freedom and democracy. They have actively tried to destroy it. In fact they have even tried to destroy Hong Kongers culture. They speak Cantonese, not Mandarin. Yet China is forcing the language on them. That is the reason Hong Kongers are fighting the Chinese goverment. There freedom, their right to democracy and free speech, is actively being taken from them. These are the values that America stands for!

The hypocrisy, to see a man who has spoken out against his own government actively deny other people right to do so is ludicrous. How would you feel if trump was able to silence his crtics with the power of the goverments might. Who would you feel if the press was not allowed to report about his actions in any light they truly see it in? 

That's the reason we value these ideals so much in the west. Sure it sometimes feels like propaganda being shoved in our faces, but if you stop and think about it there's a reason why democracy and the first amendment (and other western nations equivalents) are so important. Do not take them for granted. Actively fight for them. Totalitarianism anywhere cannot be tolerated, especially it not being imposed onto a free society.

If there ever was a such thing as

Yes China is fucked up but guess what, you don't say something like that when you have players who are currently in that country, you can put them at risk.

Also, for all the fans that sit here and at, the NBA is only woke when it's about black people...what are you willing to lose?

The NBA needs to change a lot before it sheds China. Who do you think makes the overpriced sneakers you love to wear? Who keeps the games you love to watch streamable and free? Where do you think you're getting your jerseys from....where do you think you get your Amazon orders from? Where do you think you get your clothes and phones and just about anything from?

China is a tough world power. Saying anything other than yessir is basically like slapping them in the face. It will probably take the NBA years to truly pull out of China and setup shop somewhere else. 

When or if that time comes, will you be willing to pay for it? If some basic shoes cost 120 cuz the American worker gets benefits and isn't forced to work 70 hours a week, will you buy those shoes? If the dope color version of a limited edition shoe you want takes a year to come out but costs as much as the Lonzo Ball Z02, will you buy it?

Yeah, seems like somebody should have considered the consequences and ramifications of some ignorant shit like that. Sorry LeBron and his millionaire buddies had a “difficult week,” whatever the fuck that means when you’re pulling down whatever ungodly salary his ass makes.

"&gt; Go ahead and explain what’s so capitalistic about China’s indicative planning and control of the basic means of production by the government. The presence of markets in China does not make them capitalist you dishonest hack.

Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production. China has  35-40% of business state owned which is only about 10% higher than U.S - everything else is private. It is extremely easy for a Chinese citizen to open their own private business, with more restrictions for foreigners only. Again go educate yourself instead of spouting Alex Jones type bullshit.",nba

Why have freedom of speech?  Why not just follow the ""qualified"" advice of a bunch of Ivy League educated technocrats?  I don't want to live in that kind of society.  Do you?

"Protestors in HK are probably very concerned and mobilized to act on their own accord when they see political repression of the Uyghers. Nonetheless, the two issues are not entirely of a piece. 

There is certainly a general ""trend"" of the CCP maintaining authoritarian political control over its population and elements of that have much to do with both situations.

But there are also particular aspects of both situations that are particular to those situations. How China has repressed the Uyghers in Xinjiang is related to, but not wholly parallel to what they've done in Hong Kong or what they would ever plan to do in Hong Kong.

What do you mean by ""the extradition bill is China creeping on HK significantly""? What presumptions are you making regarding the genesis of the bill and who would propose/pass/enforce it? 

What sort of acts by Hong Kong citizens, in Hong Kong, do you think would be extraditable offenses? If someone in Hong Kong does something that is legal in Hong Kong, but illegal in China, would that be cause for extradition? Do you know which offenses are listed as extraditable? How does that list compare with extradition treaties that Hong Kong and China have with other nations? Do you know which ones were initially included and later struck out due to the lobbying of the business community? Before the entire bill itself was withdrawn.

Have you weighed the potential abuses of extradition for political purposes with the logical law enforcement abilities of extradition? Such as the case of the murderer who confessed to a murder in Taiwan, with which Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement? Or the potential extradition of Hong Kong businessmen who commit crimes of corruption, tax evasion, etc. in China?",nba
Then shouldn't you turn on Morey too after he completely walked back hs tweet saying he now knows there's more perspectives? Thought there was only one perspective on human rights. Must only be OK for Morey to bitch out on his tweet and no one else to,nba

So tired of seeing all these ""I respect freedom of speech, but if you like China then you're a facist/dictator/greedy dumbshit."" from all the people who's never been to China/HK and never read about anything on China outside of CNN/FOX (this is coming from someone who's lived in HK for the past 7 years and counting). 

Instead of just looking at fake news, why not do some research on the whole situation? Do you really think it's okay to [throw petrol bombs at the police](https://www.dimsumdaily.hk/20-petrol-bombs-hurled-at-mong-kok-police-station-police-condemn-rioters-for-their-violence/), [cutting throat of random police officer in the name of freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1XQ-Yk2SGc), [plant IED aim to killing the police and anyone nearby](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3032841/duty-hong-kong-police-given-pepper-spray-after)?

"His ""clarification"" is bullshit.

You don't use the words ""misinformed"" or ""not educated"" to refer to somebody not understanding the ramifications of an action. You say something along the lines of ""didn't realize"".

You also have lines like this:

&gt;I just think that when you're misinformed, or you're not educated about something -- and I'm just talking about the tweet itself -- you never know what are the ramifications that can happen.

which pretty clearly illustrates what the ""misinformed"" is referring to. He's misinformed about something, which leads to not understanding the ramifications. This very obviously does not say that he's misinformed about the ramifications.

Harden has always wanted to shutup and dribble, he doesn't pretend to be some mogul or fake activist.  He just wants to ball and make it rain in the club.  He's true to self and later backed up the league and Free speech.  

LeBron is home and had 2 weeks for him and his group to come up with a game plan and they do this.  It's a joke, but not surprising. Don't know how people have ever been fooled by Lebrons act",nba
Yeah that was definitely a bad look. I think leaving Cleveland was a bad look even though it was well within his right as a ball player. Those are a couple examples of the things that I think aren’t too easily overlooked and made me add in the “almost”,nba
A certified Lebron hater here however he gained my respect when he opened a school and was more vocal to social issues that affects the U.S.A.

False,nba
I don’t understand why any player would think this. The PR is (rightfully) bad enough in response to their lack of support for Morey’s message. If they ousted him for it would be far worse.,nba

"Unpopular opinion: Lebron is right in this situation. Morey’s tweet absolutely was dangerous. No one is claiming that he doesn’t have a right to say what he said or that what he said is wrong in the context of first amendment rights. But as a representative of the NBA, this was a dangerous position to take. It’s easy for most us to say that what China is doing is wrong, (which it is) but for Morey to make a statement which he knew would be controversial on behalf of the Rockets, and therefore the NBA, is not okay from an employee standpoint. He has put every owner, manager, and player in an awkward position and that is not okay from a business perspective. Is it okay from a moral perspective? Yes, but he has to realize that this is more than the American objective moral perspective, because other countries do not share our morals. Downvote if you want, but I’m game for further discussion.",nba
"I think you greatly overestimate it. He's a great player and he had put his weight behind worthy causes here in the states. He didn't have a problem leaning into and against the ""shut up and dribble"" crowd.

""and trump has literally not said shit either...""

And now that you've been proven wrong when I have shown you that Trump just sided with Hong Kong at the UN, you're now saying, ""okay, well, yeah, but what has he done?"" Again, you mean outside of the trade war? Yes, the trade war isn't ""about"" the Hong Kong protests, but are you insinuating that we need to escalate above a trade war?

Also, let's go ahead and digest this for a second. And I want you to think critically on your own without falling back on whatever ""tribe"" (Democrat or Republican) you're apart of. Let's look at what was said at the UN.

-clearly in favor of Hong Kong
-treated the Chinese government with respect
-conveyed a message that China can come out of the situation unscathed 
-assured China that a resolution to the issue won't impact China's future

Now, compare what Trump said in the UN speech to what your idea of his comment on the HK/CN issue would be

""i mean it's trump so he's capable of doing all sorts of crazy ""

Uhhh... Yeah, that's gonna be a yikes from me, pal. You were all sorts of off base with this.

And now let's look at the article you are responding with. Didn't we just see the fallout from the Chinese government in regards to Morey's tweet? Do you really want the commander in chief, the leader of the military, to irritate China and not to have everyone in line, in order to ensure that trade negotiations can happen relatively smoothly? If the Chinese government reacted that way to Morey's stance, how are they going to respond if an official or the commander of the military takes a hard line stance? Going back to his UN speech, this is why it was so impactful. It treated China like a super power, was respectful and assuring in tone, but also made it clear where the US sides on the issue. It skated on thin ice perfectly.",nba

To me, that makes him a better leader already. Not saying Kyrie can't be a better leader, but he hasn't shown it especially when he was the one that asked for it.

Dončić literally saw double teams all year (being that he was Dallas' only above average offensive player). If Siakam can't handle a double team thats a knock on him.

Although no one can necessarily predict a random twitter post from someone like Daryl Morey, the escalation of the China/Hong Kong situation is evident, and with the season approaching, the likelihood that someone contracted or involved with the NBA would comment on it isn't that low. 

These people with ownership stakes in the NBA who have money to throw around definitely know and undertake in business with China, and as we can see now from the deafening silence across the NBA on this issue, they know what speaking about this issue could do to their investments.

that is the point... and in that regard Trump has not said shit... he basically described the situation... and then when China told him to shutup... he complied...  

THAT IS THE EXACT SAME THING THAT HAPPENED TO THE NBA.... 

yet we're here and you're jerking off trump for a reasoned response on HK?  

oh here is what he said about HK during the trade war talks...  

 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-11/trump-says-hong-kong-protests-will-take-care-of-itself-soon](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-11/trump-says-hong-kong-protests-will-take-care-of-itself-soon) 

&gt; “We discussed Hong Kong and I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong, and I’ve been watching and I actually told the vice premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago when I saw a lot of people, and I see far fewer now,” Trump told reporters Friday.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The president said of the demonstrations, “I think that’s going to take care of itself. I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.”  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s a “love fest” taking place between and Beijing and Washington, he added.

oh wow such bravery....  and it's pretty much exactly what he was saying at the UN... basically nothing...  

i'm not expecting him to say much... but silver basically did what trump did.... and nba coaches are what they are.... if the president isn't saying anything in that regard... what are we expecting of nba coaches....",nba

All speaking out would do is put himself and his loved ones in harms way. The American players, however, don't have family in China, would have a very large salary even without the Chinese market, and are not in China right now. There is a very VERY large difference in the consequences that Jeremey Lin faces for speaking out, compared to the consequences that say Lebron would face for speaking out. Now personally, I'm not even advocating for Lebron to speak out, but to say that Lin of all people should speak out is just ridiculous, and shows you have a very poor understanding of the situation.",nba

Now we get a bunch of bad faith arguments about how players are ""hypocrites"" for using their platform to bring light to issues that are important to them personally but NOT saying anything about literally every bad thing out there. Two years ago it was shut up and dribble, now its ""Well since you don't want to 'shut up and dribble' you should talk about everything"". And its fucking stupid.

The NBA as an entity should take a stand against China, but its fucking asinine to demand every player/coach/whatever needs to have a soundbite or they're somehow a hypocrite. Imagine how obnoxious the world would be if, in order to care about something, you had to explicitly state it on a regular basis and if you didn't address other matters or causes with the same exact enthusiasm you were viewed as an asshole.

I think we should run this season, see how everything looks together, and if it’s bad we should look to trade demar and try to see what we have in Lonnie.

"Always curious about the ramifications for Houston when it comes to signing major FAs after this. For the longest time, signing with Houston means access to the Chinese market and Chinese sponsors, because Houston's China's unofficial home team. This access puts Houston on even playing fields of teams like LA from larger media markets. 

Now, signing with Houston means you'll automatically lose access to the Chinese market. And who knows if you'll regain access after you leave. That's a lot of money and exposure you're giving up by signing with Houston. And I'm sure major shoe brands are going to discourage their athletes from signing in Houston because of this. Not to mention that a lot of athletes and employees are probably pissed at Morey behind the scenes for this whole firestorm.",nba

"This season? Probably not happening, although we have a solid team despite what most people think. Long term though: 

1.) Murray and White have to play together. Figure it out. Too much talent there to separate them.

2.) Samanic or Walker have to start showing signs of super star value. Likelihood of this happening this year is low, but next 2 years are important.

3.) DeRozan’s contract has to be priced accordingly. In my opinion he is the perfect successor to Manu as the sixth man. People really disagree with me on that part. Just my opinion.

4.) I think it’s too late for Aldridge. He’s been amazing and deserves a true shot at a title like Gasol. That ain’t happening this year. Ship him at the deadline.

5.) Defense, defense, defense. Versatility and length on the wings. Give us some damn dead eye shooters too (RIP Bertans). Find value in the draft and re-draft situations. 

Even with all that.. we may not see contention until our next superstars. Sucks but we’ve been spoiled. I’m enjoying watching the young guns for now. Go Spurs go!",nba

"NBA Merch sales in China would be a huge loss, and would be impactful almost immediately. This extends to revenue loss for players with shoe deals, where they will expect less sales compared to before the boycott.

Currently Tencent already paid for their rights for OTT broadcast so the league doesn't have to worry about it for a few years, but when that deal expires it will leave a hole.

"I think the narrative that he was truly healthy has kind of been put to rest. He got hurt in April of 2012, an ACL is a 9-12 month injury in the NBA so he was in month 12 when he was sitting out of those Nets + Heat series. He didn’t feel right, so he sat. He was 23 and was thinking about the rest of his career, and I think his fears were validated when he tore his meniscus 3 more times after the ACL. 

If anyone is to blame for it, I think it’s the Bulls. They put pressure on him in the media by saying he was cleared and it just put unfair expectations on him. 

I also think it should be noted Derrick Rose actually had a catastrophic knee injury, and that he stayed with the team during it, spoke to the media, and even sat on the bench when he was taking universal criticism for taking precaution with his health. What Kawhi did with the Spurs was much worse than anything Rose did, but no one ever attacks him for it.",nba

"Simmons is more useful to contenders right now because he’s a better fit in the NBA. He’s got speed size and quickness, and he’s a very high IQ player too anyway. He’s already useful for every team in the league if you use him as a screening big. E.g. on Houston, he’s contribute as a small ball five If you put Jokic in to Houston’s team, he neither fits the fast pace of Westbrook, nor the switch everything defence. 

Jokic is never going to be quick and he’s always going to be somewhat susceptible to PnRs and ISOing, which you see a tonne of in the NBA. Ofc the counterargument is Jokic is that good on offence that he is worth changing your offensive system for, but I don’t think he’s reached that level yet although in the playoffs he looked like the best player on the court most of the time",nba

"In the regular season i think people overstate his offence. He wasn’t really the number one option late consistently. He only just dispelled questions over his engine after his amazing playoffs where it became clear he’s not only their PG but also their most reliable scorer andshooter. Because earlier in the regular season he had games where he’d be gassed out and brick/airball floaters/hook shots late.

And if the Nuggets are going to finish top 4 they should still be trying to make Murray/Harris and maybe even MPJ or Beasley take the reigns late. Jokic can definitely be the primary offence option late like he showed when it mattered in the playoffs, but they need a bit more help so at least for the first half of the season I think they’ll try and give their guards a chance. If they find themselves a chance to miss the playoffs they’ll go through Jokic at the same levels they did in the playoffs.",nba

It's not that simple. Curry and Durant have amazing handles which is vital to getting a shot off. NBA defense is no joke and big men who can cover the perimeter are becoming more and more common.

Even without Curry's handles, off ball movement, and playmaking ability Curry's jumpshot will still have a huge impact on Giannis' game, but definitely not as much as in the hands of Curry himself who can use it to its fullest potential.",nba

"&gt;There is nothing even close to analogous to this in the West.

Try the Puerto Rico protests, which saw millions rise in an even smaller territory, only to be brutalized by police.

I will call total bullshit on the claim of two million protestors. I have watched these protests very closely; that number was essentially an ass-pull by pro-establishment MSM, when actual data scientists using facial recognition software (which counted bystanders as ""protestors"" btw) estimated [only about 250,000,](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/how-many-marched-protests-hong-kong-how-guess-crowd-size.php) or smaller than [the largest pro-China rally.](http://wap.ycwb.com/2019-08/17/content_30318903.htm)

Another analogy are the Yellow Vest protests, which have actually seen thousands injured and over a dozen killed by police, have been going on for more than a year (still counting), and have seen hundreds of thousands of protestors at their peak. The only difference is that the Yellow Vests were not 1/100th as violent as the Hong Kong riots.",nba

HK residents want to be tried in HK for crimes, not on the mainland.  That's because a defendant who is removed from HK will be far from family &amp; support.  Indeed, our own 6th Amended reflects this fact by requiring a trial in the district where the crime is alleged to have been committed.

I don't like the recent trend of labeling every thing which you find disagreeable as immoral. I think it's a dangerous approach to reality and will cause more harm than good in the long run. 

I think it's much more reasonable to accept that China and Hong Kong have some issues they need to work out and trust that they can be adult enough to work out those problems on their own. If China literally starts running over these protesters with tanks, you can have your morality argument, but right now this is an internal dispute much like we often have in the US.",nba

"Unfortunately the history of both countries are fraught with human rights abuses. For decades, American treatment of peoples on our southern border has been horrific. For centuries our treatment of the indigenous population has been horrific, to the point of genocide of these people.





Saying that there is no comparison is categorically false. The point shouldn't be to shy away from one example of a country with Jan rights abuses to bash another, it should be to condemn the acts of both and do what you as an American to advocate that your government breaks with their abuses of the past.





People get too in their feelings if you truthfully point out the faults of our own system that necessitate change. We can fix our problems while saying another country has issues as well. Fixing those issues, or even just advocating that they be addressed, makes you the exact opposite of a hypocrite.",nba

"Just to be clear, that wasn't my opinion. Rather, that was more my early impression of what people will say, regardless of whether it's true or not. I mean, every single top player has fuckwits saying stupid shit about them that's patently false. Some examples:

* LeBron - ""He's not clutch and sucks on defense""

* Harden - ""All he's good at is flopping and getting free throws""

* Giannis - ""Literally only dunks""

* Westbrook - ""Stat padder that doesn't care about winning""

* KD - ""Doesn't play defense""

* Curry - ""Can only shoot threes""

* Kawhi - ""Ballhog and is always hurt""

Etc., etc., etc. And for the record, these aren't me making things up - this is all shit that I've either seen on here before or heard from dumbass coworkers &amp; colleagues that have no idea what they're talking about. If Simmons fixes the actual issues in his gameplay for the most part, I'd be willing to bet that we'll still see people making stuff up to discredit him.",nba
"I think that stepping up to try and cause change in your country is easier than trying to change things in an authoritarian country on the other side of the world. When athletes speak out about the plights in their country it stems from often growing up in communities that suffer the similar situations or witness them daily. 

Yes its all a cynical business but they at least have a chance to do something in their own country. Morey making one tweet doesn't make one iota of a difference in how the Chinese will approach the Hong Kong situation. Trying to get every coach in the league to start shit with China changes nothing. 

What do you want to do about it? Are you going to sign up for the military and petition the government to wage war with China to liberate the Hong Kong people?

I bring this up not to blast Yao Ming, because obviously being a citizen and major face for mainland China is unlikely to make such an unpopular move.

I simply want to make the point that without a figure head and face to get things in motion, it's unlikely something this foreign, both figuratively and literally, would spark the kind of fire that would motivate players.

People want to call Steve Kerr a hypocrite, but considering his past with his father, I have little doubt in my mind he's more than just talk when it comes to the issues he's discussed in the past.

"I mean, there's a part of me that's p disappointed in Kerr (and anyone else dodging the questions), but not nearly to the degree that most ppl here are going on and on about.

It would be great if there were more ppl to take a Kaepernick-type stand (whether it's Kerr, or Harden, or LeBron, or some of the GMs and such), but on the flipside... I really think for all these guys, there is much more at stake than your own neck/job.

Given China's *extreme* sensitivity around this (and yes, Fuck China for being a giant and very rich twat about it), more incendiary comments doesn't just risk your own career. It also could damn everyone around you... your friends, those who trusted you with a job, those who count on you not to fuck them over, even those who may not be very well off at all.

Say the wrong thing and you might just fuck a very apolitical Klay out of his whole Anta deal. Or if millionaires don't count as people that can be let down, then how about all the schlubs that could and would lose their jobs if the NBA's revenues took a massive hit.

Like when Harden was kindof grovelling there for a bit instead of standing up for his GM, yeah a part of me was thinking ""damn that's a bad look"", but on thinking about it more...  all I could think was how much he represents the whole Rockets organization, how he could fuck over everyone around him by just spouting off.

(This is also why I don't fault Morey at all for retracting what he said... though thankfully not a lot of ppl are shitting on him for that for some reason.) This is a guy who has friends in Hong Kong that he was trying to support and raise awareness for, but when push came to shove... he must have realized he really stirred some shit that would impact damn near everyone in his orbit.

"Currys 2016 defensive season is bonkers good



He held opponents to 39.6% shooting as primary defender, down close to 5% from those players yearly average (5% is insaneeeee to effect)

39% is like Jaylen brown 2018 and kawhi Leonard DMVP years holding players 


He made the warriors defense better by 8.9 pts per 100 possessions,  higher than lebron or Kawhi ever effected their teams defense 


He also led the league in steals 



And this while currys team was 2nd in pace in 2016, versus the snail pace of lebrons Miami teams 



All I know, and I may look this up tomororw, is if a player is on the 2nd rated defense with pace adjusted, holds players to under 40% as primary defender , 5% worse than they normally do, and he makes his teams defense better by 8.9 pts per 100 possesions (Goberts first defensive mvp he made jazz better by 6.8 pts per 100 on defense for comparison) 


I'll guarentee those things if anyone has done them,  not only is considered good on defense, they would of made all defensive team that year 



I'll almost guarentee any guard that's a  starter that hold players to even 41% and under, made their team defense better by 3.0 pts or more, and led league in steals made all defense.....and currys doing that x2 on a run and gun team

"\&gt;  I just don't understand why absolutely anyone gives a shit about these guys opinions. 

Honestly, even though I posted this comment, I don't really care either. Unfortunately, so many people do, and it does kind of make sense, people look up to these stars. So if you want to reach them, you need to play the game. Awareness is huge.

\&gt;  It kinda makes sense when they live in America and they grew up here,  some from pretty shitty parts of the country. They are commenting on  their past, their countries present, and its potential future. 

Totally reasonable.

\&gt;  Literally there ONLY connection to China, is their business dealings, because it allows them to have a profitable pre-season. 

Someone who has come from such places as you mentioned above should definitely see the parallel between their struggles and those of the people of Hong Kong. I'd almost go as far to say it should put in perspective how much worse off these people in Hong Kong really are, and how much they could use the attention gathered by someone of Harden's status talking about it.

Today at work I was talking about this issue with two people, and neither of them had any idea of any specifics in any of this. They both said something along the lines of ""Yea, I heard some shit about China recently."" Both of these guys are huge NBA fans, and when Harden speaks, they listen.

\&gt;  It's like ya'll are just salivating at the mouth for a player to say  ""Fuck China"" like that will do absolutely anything but make their  individual lives more difficult, and literally improve not a single  persons well being. 

James Harden and his immediate family are going to have very easy lives for the next couple generations. He has that kind of fuck you money. Again, awareness is huge, and when you play politics and activism sometimes, it should look bad the times you choose not to for the sake of money.

\&gt;  The players want to talk about what the players want to talk about, they  should not be EXPECTED to comment on anything, they are FUCKING  basketball players lol 

I mostly agree with this statement. Maybe I am expecting too much. But they weren't just basketball players when who ever the hell said ""shut up and dribble"".",nba

"&gt; It starts with us carrying about the people being oppressed, and that requires a cultural shift. I don't know about you, but the NBA being involved in this has gotten me to become far more educated and opinionated on China and the issues it is causing for people.

I'm aware of the issues it is causing people, but as I stated I really don't see how we can *do* anything. China is an extremely powerful country and the U.S. is not in a position to go against them, and lose a significant amount of money - and lives - trying to stop oppression that is happening in their own country. If it gets to the point where China is affecting us beyond threatening to pull out business deals then I'm all for doing something consequences be damned. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, and there is something we *can* do, but I don't believe I am at this point in time.

&gt; Kerr is in a position of cultural influence. By speaking out he brings attention to the issue, and gets us to care more. Which is what he did with other social issues, and Trump in general, but is not doing here.

Kerr is in a position to speak his mind on issues that affect people in his own country. He is not in a position to speak about issues that could help result in loss of revenue in the NBA, and as a result jobs of people who have nothing to do with it. I understand wanting to say something and speak out, but I also understand not wanting to put yourself in a position where people blame you for losing their job.",nba

Now you wanna use the fact that LeBron created a brand image of being more than just an athlete. LeBron has already proven himself as more than just an athlete , LeBron has spoken out against police brutality, LeBron has spoken out against injustice, LeBron has spoken out in support of families who want justice for their lost loved ones, LeBron has put his money where his mouth is in his home states communities and in communities in south Florida too, LeBron has stepped up and funded college scholarships for young underprivileged kids, LeBron has been an exemplary role model for kids everywhere, no drugs, domestic violence, crazy run ins with the law, or anything like that. He IS more than an athlete and has proven that completely already. 

Seriously though fuck all that nonsense, trying to use that branding campaign to make it seem like because LeBron hasn’t said anything about Hong Kong yet that he is not living up to his image , he already has lived up to it. He is also contractually obligated to follow the rules of the NBA , LeBron isn’t bigger than the legal system , you’re truly reaching to make LeBron look bad but it’s all reach no substance.",nba

The only bill I saw proposed was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would sanction the Chinese if need be and allow special visa rights to Hong Kong people seeking asylum. 

Now, should we do those things? Of course, it obviously better than nothing.

Maybe I was coming off kinda dickish, but I just think some people may be expecting too much out of this situation. We can and should stand by Hong Kong, but I feel as if some people don’t realize there really is so much we can do. The Chinese government is fucking demented. They would sooner kill themselves than to lose to the capitalist powers. 

And I think it’s great that people are raising awareness on this issue but I don’t really like how it’s turned us against each other, as if people need to validate that they support democracy. Rather than fighting to end the human rights abuses in China, what we should be doing is fighting for our rights to talk about the issue freely and fighting against immoral business dealings by US corporations.

Shut the hell up no one is against human rights you're twisting words around.

"I am not arguing the potential ramifications of the bill. I agree that the bill is unprecedented in nature and needs to be revised and revisited before it can be codified. I agree that the extraordinarily short 20 day public review period proposed by Carrie Lam is outrageous, considering China has not established itself as a fair arbiter of justice for extradition. I agree that the courts should have more of a say in determining who gets extradited on a case-by-case basis instead of having that power rest solely with the chief executive. I agree that this is a step in the wrong direction for HK given the current judicial environment in the PRC. 

I started this whole conversation to shine a light on how much background there really is and how it is unreasonable to expect Steph Curry to know this much about what the protests are about, why the protests are occurring, and why both China and HK might feel upset about what each views as a violation of their respective sovereignty.  

It's doesn't matter that you think the Poon Hiu Wing case is a trojan horse. The fact remains that this case is being used to establish legal precedent and that makes the case relevant.",nba

You wanted to be practical instead of arguing purely out of ideology right? There's your practical answer.

Right now pretty much the argument against it is to demoralize or to dissuade discussion. It's annoying to keep hearing about this if you don't really care but what can you do? Just forget about it?

The heroes of the NBA in the early 2000s enjoyed greater love in China than the players today. Part of it stems from Chinese admiration of odds-defying derring-dos like what T-Mac/AI/Kobe/Drose/etc have continually strived to show their fans.,nba

It's common and entirely natural for human beings to employ humor when dealing with serious, even deadly serious, situations.  I think you've come away with the wrong idea if you think joking means people don't understand the severity of what's going on.

"Dude this is a societal problem right now and it's becoming dangerous and terrifying. Basically if you aren't speaking out against something, you are obviously for it. That's hardly ever the entire story. Social media has made it so everyone can voice their opinion at a moment's notice. And it doesn't even have to be a well researched opinion. But it doesn't matter because you'll still get attention and praise for it because you ""spoke out"". But if you stay silent, it somehow means you aren't against that thing. That's bullshit. It's incredibly damaging to our society. It is perfectly ok to just say ""I don't know and I'm not the one to ask.""

I absolutely support the right for LGBT people to do whatever they want in their personal lives and with their bodies. But I'm not going to post about it or really ever bring it up in conversation because I'm a straight white male with nothing to add. But there's people now who say my silence means I don't support them. There's people now who say because I didn't add the Q or whatever to when I wrote 'LGBT' earlier it means I don't support them. And I take the Niemöller poem to heart, I think it's our responsiblity to speak up when called upon to support each other and make each other feel accepted and safe. But maybe me shutting the fuck up gives air for someone who is actually a part of that group to speak for themselves. Maybe my opinion shiouldn't be the one that matters when I'm not the one being discriminated against or trampled by my government. 

And to your point, these are athletes. It's fucking sad that we have stooped so low that we are so concerned with the thoughts of celebrities. Like you said, there's not a single word that Bron or Steph could say that's going to turn shit around. And if you're one of the ones waiting with bated breath to speak up, make sure you're doing something to help those people too.",nba

"They already have so much. So much more than most of us could imagine. Their privilege in that matter is straight up astounding. Many players and coaches have used that privilege as a pedestal to speak on things they care about/thought were right. When absolutely nothing was on the line. Now when something's on the line, yes millions of dollars, millions of dollars as a drop in the bucket which is already overflowing with countless millions of dollars, every last one is silent. Every last one is choosing money ie greed over what they likely think is right. Therefore, they're all goddamn hypocrites and I don't want to hear anymore bullshit about how progressive they are as individuals and the league is as a whole. In the west it's currently profitable to support progressive causes. In China it's currently profitable to keep your mouth shut. They're playing both sides strictly for the profit.

"People are criticizing them for putting money over human rights.  Especially when the league gives itself such a socially conscious, holier than thou image, it reeks of hypocrisy.  It's easy to stand up for whats right when it doesn't cost you anything, but when the league, players, and coaches had their chips on the table, they decided to shut up and dribble instead of losing out on some money when they are already wealthier than entire third world countries.  It makes them look no better mob wives.  Here's just a sneak peak of some of China's greatest hits of recent years:

* Hundreds of human rights lawyers (not even dissidents, just the LAWYERS who defended people) were snatched by gestapo all over China in what is known as the [709 Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/709_crackdown).

* One of those lawyers, Wang Quanzhang was [sentenced to 4.5 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/wang-quanzhang-china-sentences-human-rights-lawyer-to-four-years-in-prison) for ""subversion of state power"". But that's not enough. China actually [went after Wang's 6-year-old son](https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/), forcing him out of his school and banning any other school from taking him in.

* A dissident, [Wang Bingzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Bingzhang_(dissident\)) was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison after a closed trial that lasted 1 day.

* A man wore a t-shirt with the word ""Xitler"" on it and [was disappeared](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/03/young-chinese-activist-missing-after-sharing-plan-to-wear-xitler-t-shirt-on-cpc-anniversary-report/). Eventually he was [tried for ""subversion of state power"" while barred from meeting with lawyers](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/15/chinese-xitler-activist-trial-subversion-lawyers-barred-seeing/)

* Another man, [Wang Meiyu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/death-of-chinese-activist-in-police-custody-prompts-calls-for-investigation-into-torture) hold up a placard calling for Xi’s resignation &amp; democracy. He was arrested for ""picking quarrels”. He ended up dead in custody.

* A woman live streamed herself [splashing ink on a Xi poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sF34fJwh0). She was [disappeared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-woman-dong-yaoqiong-disappears-spraying-ink-xi-jinping-a8455166.html). Her last social media update: *""Right now there are a group of people wearing uniforms outside my door. I’ll go out after I change my clothes. I did not commit a crime. The people and groups that hurt me are the ones who are guilty""*. Later on there was report of her being [sent to a psychiatric hospital](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/23/chinese-protester-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-poster-sent-psychiatric-hospital-report/)

* After the ink-splash woman's disappearance her father made a series of broadcast to call attention to her plight. He ended up getting [taken away by the police in the middle of a live stream](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/14/police-interrupt-youtube-live-stream-father-missing-chinese-woman-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-photo/)

* 5 people associated with a Hong Kong bookstore that sold titles such as ""*Xi Jinping and His Six Women*"" were [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Only one managed to escape back to HK. He held a press briefing to tell the world about his kidnapping by China. He's now in exile in Taiwan. The other 4 are still somewhere in China.

And, of course

* [1.5 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ) Uyghurs rounded up in concentration camps

* Genocide through [forced abortions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) on Uyghur women

* [Sexual torture](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) of Uyghur women such as rape &amp; rubbing intimate parts with chili paste.

* [Leaked footage](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d722aw/chinas_detention_of_uighurs_video_of_blindfolded/) of a large number of blindfolded Uyghurs shackled together

* A Canadian journalist [wanted to debunk reports of Chinese anti-Muslim repression so he went on a stage-managed show tour put on by China](https://nationalpost.com/news/canadian-went-to-china-to-debunk-reports-of-anti-muslim-repression-but-was-shocked-by-treatment-of-uyghurs). That means he only saw a fake Potemkin village that China actually thought was acceptable by Western standard. But the brutality of even this fake Potemkin village stunned him. Now imagine what's really happening in the real concentration camps where millions of Uyghurs are being held. Imagine how bad the true situation is.

* Using minorities &amp; political prisoners as [free organ farms](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c1my5j/china_is_harvesting_organs_from_detainees_uk/). A doctor's [eye witness account](https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/chinese-dissidents-are-being-executed-for-their-organs-former-hospital-worker-says/): *'The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive. The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his two kidneys. Then the doctor ordered Zheng to remove the man’s eyeballs. Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and Zheng froze. “I can’t do it,” he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man’s eyeballs himself.'*

* Call for [retraction of 400 Chinese scientific papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners) amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners

* [15 Chinese studies retracted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/15-15-studies-retracted-due-to-fears-they-used-chinese-prisoners-organs/) due to fears they used Chinese prisoners' organs

* [Cultural genocide (and organ harvests, of course)](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-uyghur-muslim-rules-laws-treatment-chinese-human-rights-religion-a8534161.html). A uyghur's testimony: *""First, children were stopped from learning about the Quran, then from going to mosques. It was followed by bans on ramadan, growing beards, giving Islamic names to your baby, etc. Then our language was attacked – we didn’t get jobs if we didn’t know Mandarin. Our passports were collected, we were told to spy on each other, innocent Uyghur prisoners were killed for organ harvesting""*

* China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority Hui Muslim. ['Afraid We Will Become The Next Xinjiang': China's Hui Muslims Face Crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown): *""The same restrictions that preceded the Xinjiang crackdown on Uighur Muslims are now appearing in Hui-dominated regions. Hui mosques have been forcibly renovated or shuttered, schools demolished, and religious community leaders imprisoned. Hui who have traveled internationally are increasingly detained or sent to reeducation facilities in Xinjiang.""*",nba

"The conspiratorial side of me has to wonder if the riot going on on social media over this the last few days is part of the same influence campaigns that we saw in 2016.  The trade war is a disaster for the US, so the second China does something shitty that involves an American company the bots come out yelling about it to whip up a frenzy and make Trump look like he’s been right about the need to pick a fight with China this entire time.

The Chinese government sucks and commits human rights atrocities on a daily basis and has for decades.  That isn’t in contention.  I’m skeptical of how genuine this outcry is though, especially when the Hong Kong issue is fairly tame compared to other shit China has done/is doing.  Not to mention other absolutely brutal regimes around the world that Reddit doesn’t seem to give a fuck about.  If you’re truly concerned about human rights, try taking a look at Saudi Arabia.",nba

i mean kanter is getting hunted by a country.... you want curry's opinion on that too?  how about you write down all your demands right here and i'll see if i can get a response for you.....

"Yeah the history of Japan and China is one of Japan invading China many times over, with the reverse never occurring except under Mongolian occupation. Is that what you meant by history? Whereas the vast majority of American involvement in the middle east has occurred post WWII and has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the instability that is currently plaguing the region. 911 is terrible but to compare it to Nanking is absurd. They are two totally different situations with different causes and results. Are the Paris attacks in anyway similar in impact and scale, despite being very similar in terms of the goals of the perpetrators and the reasons behind what they did? Fuck no, there is a large difference between 911 and that and you fucking know it you bloody fucking idiot. According to your logic, 911 is just as bad as the holocaust because their intents were somewhat similar. Both are bad, but let's be fucking real here. There's only so much you can pull with the relativity card.

If I am the shill that you claim me to be, it's pretty sad how little you know of world history for a supposedly enlightened and free person. I had to do a double take when you brought up the 'history' between Japan and China as if to disprove my point about Nanking, you need to do some fact checking about who was invading who for basically all of their shared relations.",nba

"This is such a bs point and low effort post to kill any discussion.

Hell, Kerr is already a multimillionaire with some of the best job security in the world; if the Warriors were that stupid to fire him, any other NBA team not the Nets would hire him. If he got fired and never worked again, he'd be completely fine and continue to live a life financially better off than 0.1% of all Americans.

The average Joe that you critique ""types this from the comforts of their reddit account"" legit can't do anything about it; most of us here don't have the luxury to get fired and then ever work again.

If anything, if these figures are getting paid millions, I'd expect them to open their mouths, especially one as vocal about social justice as Kerr.

If he wants to stand there, critique the US President - as he very much should - and receive all the praise/good publicity that comes from a low effort/low risk talking point, then I expect him to critique China as well, especially since he doesn't even need to address the HK/China situation. If he wants to stand back from geopolitical shitstorm that is HK/China, whatever; but the issue here that's actual close to home is how the NBA's involvement in China has forced the NBA's hand - and has forced other Americans to keep their opinions silenced for the sake of money.

Morey has had to delete his tweet and backtrack. Silver initially put up one of the weakest responses to toe the line right in the middle, before taking a stance against China.

That's what we want him to speak about.",nba

"You're confusing China being the company that currently has basically all the world's capacity to mine it's rare earths with China being the only country that possess rare earths. The US itself has tons of rare earths within its own borders and was actually the leading exporter of it until as late as the 80s. It just doesn't exact them anymore because it is process that causes a lot of pollution so it's mines were mostly shut down and the production moved to China which like the US has a lot of rare earth but had less of a concern about the pollution. Again you're thinking in the short term and that's not what this conversation is about. 

&gt;[As trade tensions rise between the U.S. and China, rare earth minerals are once again in the political spotlight. Today Chinese mines and processing facilities provide most of the world's supply, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hinted about using this as political leverage in trade negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. But in the long run, many experts say the global market involving these materials would likely survive even if China completely stopped exporting them.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-panic-about-rare-earth-elements/)

Sure, our government’s definitely not perfect, but don’t call me, random citizen of America, a hypocrite for the sins I didn’t commit. You certainly shouldn’t disregard any opinion I have based on my nationality.

The Chinese government couldn't give a flying fuck about what Daryl Morey says.  The conspiracy theory that's prevalent is that every single entity in China is somehow taking orders from the CCP is just farcical and shows a complete ignorance of how China actually works.

Okay, so this is my thought process:

CCP stands for “Chinese Communist Party,” I understand. I also understand that this party has a singular authoritarian rule of the country. The means of production are state-owned under certain communist regimes, so it would follow that I shouldn’t trust supposedly government independent corporatians that could very well be government puppets.

The Chinese version of r/nba tried too delete those morey post at first (You know, to calm things down.) But the fans pushed so hard that they have to restore those deleted post.  It's our fans call Tencent to ban rockets game , and mad at Tencent for don't react quick enough. When Tencent banned Rockets, nothing but praise for Tencent, same as CCTV. I know you guys probably think ""those post must be government propoganda, outrage is fake, all angry fans are bots."" It's just simply not true. Lots of my friend, personal friend is very mad at Morey (call that brainwashed or whatever), but certainly not fake.  So the last paragraph of your post are otherworldly redicilous, shows that you know nothing about China.",nba
"I'm sorry, and maybe it's the cynic in me, but this isn't an issue about not standing up for every cause.

This is an issue that boils down to money. Every figure in the NBA plays up their public image; the NBA has been playing the public image game for years. That's why Allen Iverson was such a controversial figure, that's why the NBA instituted a dress code after Malice at the Palace.

But it's bullshit that these ""beloved"" public figures will sit here - like Kerr, Pop, Lebron - while making millions of dollars and easily speak out against Donald Trump -  as they should - to boost their image given it's easily low hanging fruit but when their revenue is on the line all of a sudden hush themselves.

"So, let me summarize, we help them, if we accept that:

one tweet from a GM - gets his team banned

The statement from Silver ""we don't control everything our employees tweet (on their private account)"" - gets the whole League banned

and as reaction to that, nobody has an opinion

&amp;#x200B;

Is that right??? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't follow this logic! I'm all about diplomacy and understanding, but once they decide to collectively punish a team and the whole league, just because one individual voiced an opinion that isn't regime confirmatory, in this drastic manner, it is about time to take a stand. The damage is done and everything of a magnitude  that would change that, wouldn't mean we're teaching them something beyond their current approach, but exactly playing into those aspects that make the China of today a huge liability. I don't want to dispute their potential and I don't want to glorify the west, but we can't censor ourselves to this degree to appease a regime like this.

"No it didn't.  For the vast majority of Hong Kong's history, any Chinese who came to Hong Kong had less freedom than the British/other Europeans there, and they achieved true universal suffrage.  For most of Hong Kong's existence, the colony had two sets of laws, one for Europeans and one for the Chinese.  [Chinese were not allowed to live in the most desirable districts, and all laws were written only in English despite the vast majority of the population being only able to speak Cantonese](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2348771).  When Chinese Hong Kongers protested against British colonial rule in 1966, [the British put them down with force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_1967_leftist_riots).  

Despite became a British colony in 1841, (and despite the UK itself granting all citizens over the age of 21 voting rights in 1918), Hong Kong only got the right to vote for even a portion of their legislative council in 1991, 150 years after colonization.  Even then, they could only vote for [18 seats out of the total 60 legislative council seats](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-16/was-hong-kong-ever-promised-democracy-fact-check/5809964) (although this number was increased to 30 in 1995) and only certain sections of Hong Kong could vote for these seats.

"I don't support the HK protests whatsoever.  However, this is no longer about the HK protests but rather about the slippery slope of self-censorship and compromising core American values.  No matter if you are a liberal or conservative, liberatarian or socialist, I think we can all agree that the first amendment is an important issue.  

I have seen many videos regarding NBA China and NBA players in China - and I can see that they are as fervent and dedicated as any American fans.  I am genuinely heartbroken for the Chinese fans who face the prospect of losing the NBA.  Yes they can always stream the games but imagine being banned from wearing your team's jersey when you go out, not being able to buy gear, being shut out of the NBA community, and relegated to the outside looking in.  But I have to agree 100% with Max.

\---SAS twisting himself in to a pretzel only to circle back time and again ""but money though""

\---Whataboutism by SAS regarding Rosa Parks and Arab Israeli conflict - both cringey especially given he's talking to a Jew.  The comparisons don't make sense to me. 

\---in a later video SAS remarks that common people are never expected to comment on the Arab Israeli conflict or other world issues.  True, but he fails to recognize that the US has an intimate relationship with China and Morey's comments are therefore more relevant in that regard.

"So what?

This guy [got it right](https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2019/10/07/yes-boycott-garbage-nba-china-ass-kissing/) IMO:

&gt;Yeah, I’m aware that a mass boycott of one of the four major sports isn’tgoing to happen, especially with Zion Williamson debuting this season and lots of intriguing off-season roster shuffles. And if a mass boycott ever did happen, it wouldn’t be triggered by a dispute in a foreign country on the other side of the world.

&gt;This isn’t a “we’ll make this happen!” rallying cry. This is an argument that it should happen. If the only moral language these venal scumbags understand is money, then the obvious thing to do is send them a message in that language.

&gt;Scout’s honor: I was going to buy a league pass to watch the games this year because of Zion and Ja Morant and to follow the new-look Lakers and Clippers. After this, not one dime. Philip Klein gets to the heart of my disgust. It’s not just the kowtowing to China that’s repulsive, it’s the cumulative hypocrisy of one “woke” American industry after another congratulating themselves for their progressive activism here at home while lapping up Chinese blood money. Mass internment of Chinese Muslims, organ harvesting, religious oppression, an ever more intrusive surveillance state, and no one says a word — until finally Hong Kongers stand up for their rights and the NBA’s moral degenerates rush to take sides with the oppressor.

&gt;F*** these people, one and all. Sometimes that’s all you can say.

He goes on to make an excellent critique of Tsai's piece.

Anywya, even though a boycott isn't going to happen, people should express their outrage and make decisions at the margin being aware of the issue. I grew disenchated with the CCP about 10-15 years ago when things started going backwards. They've been getting worse in the last few years and that has affected my decisions, even if I don't ""boycott China"".

But I'll keep speaking out against the CCP, I'll keep making politicians stances on the CCP and how to deal with it a major factor on my voting decisions, I'll keep promotingthe idea of decoupling from China as long as the CCP is in power and I'll keep beind mindful of major Chinese companies that are mere CCP peons, including Huawei, Alibaba and so on.",nba

1) if your government is so great, why can’t you guys get laid and married? 

Oh right because you KILLED off the girls and now you have way too many dudes and not enough women. 

No wonder all you guys just stay in cyber cafes. Probably you will need to be homosexuals since there aren’t enough women to go around. 

2) if China is so great, why do you have to use a VPN to talk to anyone else outside of China lol? No one wants to use wechat or Weibo - you live in a sandbox. 

3) China is just not original - you can make a lot of stuff but you just copy and mix it all together. There are so many Frankenstein characteristics in their products. Like Pizza In China is so weird - they’ll just throw ANYTHING on it. Or Chinese 8 ball - they mixed 8 ball pool with snooker. 

4) Chinese are not original thinkers 

I remember a story in college when a professor had a Chinese student who was really smart and could read off all the material from other scholar. He could tell the professor exactly what different scholars on the subject think. 

But then the professor asked him, “what do YOU think?” The student was speechless and was like “what?...I don’t know what I think” and had like a mini mental breakdown. 

5) bring up the yulin dog meat festival. If China was so great, why do they still allow dogs to be electrocuted and tortured ? You can’t even shut down one stupid festival. 

6) talk about how they dress like dumb Hicks which is what they do. Mainland Chinese have no taste, especially the rich kids. They just buy the tackiest with the biggest price tags and it doesn’t even go together. As long as it says Gucci or LV, they’ll wear sandals with it.",nba

What I would want is for the NBA to have a consistent set of political values that they stick to and, when a certain issue is especially relevant, as Hong Kong is now and police brutality cases have been in the past (and will be in the future), take appropriate action based on those values. Obviously under capitalism this is highly unrealistic but that would be the goal. Being ""apolitical"" as you put it would in fact be an implicit endorsement of whichever party in these injustices has the most power, like the Chinese government or the police. With the Charlotte thing taking no action would have communicated that the bathroom bill and actions of the NC government were acceptable to them. When the NBA is put in the position to do or say something, they always should, as to do nothing is to be part of the power structure which creates these situations.",nba

In the foreword:
&gt;quote Another power is a far greater threat to freedom—and that  is  China.  The  Chinese  Communist  Party  has  grown  increasingly  despotic  and  imperialistic  in  recent  years;  it  brutally enforces its model of totalitarianism at home and seeks to spread it globally. It employs a nasty array of military  aggression,  intimidation,  imprisonment,  and  execution  of  opponents  domestically,  with  increasingly  blatant  use of those tools against external opponents. Its economic  clout  is  used  to  bribe,  corrupt,  intimidate,  and  indebt  nations around the world.

The foreword explains and outlines the threat of China. Read the whole thing.

&gt;quote Thousands  demonstrate  in  Hong  Kong  for  freedom  and  vote  for  independence-minded  candidates  who  want  nothing to do with mainland totalitarianism. This opposition has led to growing mainland interference, which is undermining freedom. Hong Kong has fallen from the freest jurisdiction in the world in 2014 to the third freest in 2016 (the year for which the most recent data are available) and is likely to fall further.

Bro I can't believe that people on this sub can't understand how LeBron and other American basketball ball players are more likely to stand up for domestic issues. Like they are Americans living in America it makes since they are more likely to speak up on American issues. Whats confusing about that? Is LeBron not allowed to speak up on American topics if he doesn't speak out against china. What do you think having him speak out against china accomplishes?

The primary purpose of a corporation is provide returns for its shareholders.

They will not take on causes that will affect their sales negatively.

In my opinion, they are not inherently evil (although some are pretty shit).

"I do think your title can be changed to “The NBA chooses to be politically sensitive and not piss off an entire country”. Like maybe go ask the Vietnamese whether the Amercians were right to invade Vietnam and spray Chemical Orange there, you might get a much varied response. So my point being is, I am totally fine with individual players expressing any political belief, but when one is an executive and can be seen to represent an organization, being politically sensitive is the right way to go. So if Morey wants to tell all his friends about why China is a bunch of sick fascists by all means, but when he posts his comments in a public forum in his capacity as a team GM, that does not sit well.",nba
"In this first four years, LeBron played 20 first round games. Michael Jordan played 15. You can act like an entire fourth of the potential games, are ridiculous but it's not. Every year in the playoffs, that's between 1-4 games of difference. If you're averaging 30 ppg then that's 30-120 points of difference per year. That's an extra 150 points of differential between Jordan and LeBron because of the difference in 4 years.

650 points of advantage is large when we're talking about 8000, points. That's like a twelfth of the total. LeBron is already on his 16th season. Michael scored approximately 1000 points less than LeBron in the playoffs. That means LeBron had an extra season to do it but that doesn't give context either because LeBron also had more games per playoffs to do it in. 

In conclusion, yeah it makes a difference. Like wtf. How do you think that doesn't count. Not to mention including playoffs totals doesn't make sense because it gives you a negative for ending series earlier. Like the 2016-17 warriors scored more per game than the 17-18 warriors in the playoffs but also played 4 fewer games. Should the 17-18 warriors get accolades for scoring more total points? No, that's dumb.",nba

""Morey later deleted it, but not before Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta saw it on Twitter and quoted it with a response clarifying that it was not the franchise’s position.

A day later, numerous Chinese sponsors, and even the Chinese Basketball Association — with former Rockets franchise icon Yao Ming as its president — suspended their ties with the team.

**In addition, Tencent Sports announced Sunday that all live streaming and news reporting of the Rockets would be suspended. The company gave customers who bought a subscription to watch Houston games online the opportunity to pick another NBA team**""

Uh ohhh. The dudes who propped up reddit  are an economic extortion device of the totalitarian Chinese government. 


""Reddit  is raising $150 million to $300 million to keep the front page of the internet running, multiple sources tell TechCrunch. The forthcoming Series D round is said to be led by **Chinese tech giant Tencent** at a $2.7 billion pre-money valuation. Depending on how much follow-on cash Reddit drums up from Silicon Valley investors and beyond, its post-money valuation could reach an epic $3 billion.""

"&gt; Yeah, soaring from an agricultural backwater to literally the world's new second superpower in only 30 years, another failure of communism\*.

*(Actually capitalism)

I don't agree with the post you were replying to, communism has zero to do with China's rabid nationalism. But China's sincere attempt to implement communism was a major reason _why it was an agricultural backwater in the first place_. It rose from a second-rate power suffering from civil war and Japanese invasion in the 1930's, all the way to a simple second-rate power in the 1970's, thanks to Mao's communism. Then Deng Xiaoping said ""Hey, let's go ahead and be totally capitalist, but keep calling ourselves communist anyway"" and the country boomed and became a superpower.

"First of all, stop acting like you are the only smart person on the internet. Both-sideing an issue doesn’t make you more informed it makes you sound like a pretentious fucking asshole. If you think Morey all of a sudden changed his mind on this issue after 24 hours then you’re an idiot. The correct move by the NBA would be to do absolutely nothing. There was no reason for them to make any sort of statement on this regardless of if they are losing Chinese sponsors. 

Lastly, the reason the NBA felt compelled to put out a statement was to save face amongst it’s Chinese fans and partners. A completely reasonable and appropriate response by NBA fans who don’t agree with the NBA’s actions is to voice their displeasure so that the league knows that there are negative consequences for it’s brand because of their actions. That’s what NBA fans who disagree with this are doing. Get off you’re fucking high horse. If you are fine with the NBA’s response then fine. But there are a lot of people who are not and they have just as much right to voice their opinion as you do.",nba

"This is not a Streisand effect situation, like people are saying. China’s goal is not to make people not see Morey’s tweet, and make sure it gets deleted. The literal tweet doesn’t matter. The purpose of this is to send a message, to show their clout and influence, and to demonstrate that prominent American figures should refrain from commenting on the situation. 

This strategy *wants* media coverage of this. The whole point is that China is demonstrating how effectively it will actually commit to these tactics (many countries complain, few actually take action like this). 

This is very very different than the Streisand effect. If China actually cared about the literal tweet, and this was just a means to get it deleted, then that would be relevant. As is, media coverage is expected and desired. They’ll be frustrated that Morey wasn’t fired (assuming he isn’t), but heartened that they were able to bully an apology out of him and the NBA. 

On the whole, this Mostly worked. They didn’t get total compliance, but they was no mass uprising among the stars. and the NBA showed quite a bit of deference. Future public figures are going to be a lot more careful about how they address Hk.",nba

"You’re describing the “NBA” as one person , it’s an omnibus entity. Realize there is the players union, coaches union, 30 different owners, corporate stakeholders and the commissioners office. Adam Silver can make certain unilateral decisions but he has to answer to ALL of the stakeholders he represents. 

You’re acting like Adam Silver benevolently picks and chooses which issues he wants to support. The NBA doesn’t “allow” Lebron to have an opinion, they have no choice because the Players union is a powerful stakeholder who protect Lebron’s right to be outspoken. 

And  your point 3. Yes, this is how corporations work. All corporations answer to their stakeholders. Adam Silver is no different , he is only commissioner because the owners ratified him. It’s a privilege not his right. If they don’t like what he’s doing they could remove him in a second and no one would stop them. In this situation, Adam Silver is doing the bidding of the owners who have no desire to run afoul of Chinese sponsorships. If it was a Players union issue then they would flex their power but this issue isn’t their jurisdiction.",nba

Unless he’s gone full “25 pounds of muscle” in the off-season he’d be a disaster against Embiid or Horford, but he can definitely take on Harris or Richardson without much worry.

"I guess me and my entire family in Xinjiang would be arrested already. We did shit on the CCP on multiple occasions both in public and on dinner tables, no one really gave a damn and it’s not like we’re planning to overthrow the government or something.

I’m not sure if you understand the [extent of the violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_conflict) during the Hu Jintao era in Xinjiang. The CCP response is a complete overreaction, but because of the context behind it the proportion of the population who are OK enough such that they’ll keep quiet (not to mention that Western press severely exaggerate the facts; my grandparents had to go to classes every two weeks to basically listen to propaganda).

The fact is, the general opinion of the CCP nowadays is better than it was during during the Hu Jintao days because people saw tangible economic growth. It’s the cumulation of that, 70 years of pro-CCP propaganda and the fact that what the Turkestan extremists did were completely unacceptable to those who are not strong believers of the religion (which there aren’t many, since the influence of religion have dwindled since 1949). The media paints a picture of a Xinjiang that is on the verge of independence - it is not. Its best opportunity was in the 70s and 80s.

I’ll probably be downvoted, called a chinese shill (yes I post on r/Sino), and it’s unlikely many will change their perception of Xinjiang from what I said. But if your default behaviour when met with something that’s opposite of your perception is to ensure that others don’t see it/dislike it (by the way, not what downvoting is for), then perhaps you’re just not as open to new things as you think.",nba

"Lol that’s data dude. Why would it matter if it’s from YouTube? It also charts nearly every defensive possession of Draymond guarding AD. So either you don’t know what cherry picking is or you haven’t looked at the footage or your being willfully ignorant because your too proud to acknowledge you were wrong on something and you don’t much like the idea that there are people who can guard AD

Also copy pasted? So what if it’s copy pasted? How else do I link data? 



The cherry pick thing is obviously a defense mechanism at this point

I disagree, how are they fallacious arguments? If it’s that obvious you should be able to explain it. 

Ok he dropped 30 on good efficiency in multiple playoff series, that still doesn’t mean they didn’t guard him well. To evaluate NBA defense that is way is pretty much street mentality, it’s the type of thing you’d hear at the local YMCA facility. When we actually look at comprehensive footage and analyze it we get a clear understanding of defensive impact. Footage is the best way to measure individual defense as stats are susceptible to too many factors that can affect the integrity of the data. 

What facts have I ignored? I gotta say that’s very interesting coming from a guy who literally did just that


As opposed to you who has displayed no evidence of anything and just keeps pointing out the raw stat of AD averaging 30. I really don’t think you’re in a position to criticize anybody’s ability to site evidence 

I do think that, and so does the warriors coaching  staff which includes Steve Kerr who is one of the top coaches in the NBA and one of the most successful coaches in NBA history. I guess he’s delusional too because he actually put him on AD/Lebron at times during the game



Are you normally belligerent and insulting towards the people you sorry for? That’s a very odd way to express your feelings",nba

"Absolutely, again, he took down the tweet. I could be wrong but I seriously doubt that was of his own accord especially when his owner quoted the tweet and distanced himself from those comments. I think NBA owners and shoe companies making it clear to their employees that they are not to take a stance on this issue is a fair assumption to make. And again, my original point was that an NBA player speaking out on this issue is far from a slippery slope to them having to take a position on every international issue which is what OP's argument was. In this case, the situation is directly tied to an NBA GM, what's even more chilling is the fact that apparently it's now being reported that ownership considered replacing Morey. This is a huge deal to me, it genuinely makes me sick to my stomach, I don't care how much I get downvoted it's just my opinion.

"&gt; when you think of a professional basketball gym, you think wooden floors and a roof

Not really. I don't and most of people I know don't. In fact when I saw the first basketball game on TV I was surprised to see that it is indoors. It is like saying when you see football stadium you see those superbly maintained turf pitch with immaculate grass and so on. But we all know that is not the case. I think your point of view is biased based on your own experiences and mine by my own. The thing is that outside US, especially in developing countries, people do not think a roof and wooden floors are necessary for basketball. I am still not getting into the argument regarding what is cheap and what is not but that part about concrete floors is true.",nba

A 1 bedroom apt in the Midwest is 500-600 a month. I know that's not where a majority of homeless are, but if those people were given the means to take their ubi and relocate, they would have a chance to go to where they can begin to build a life.

"Well, that also their ""nationalism"" is not nationalism we're used to at the western world. It's more to do with their recent history and I highly doubt any Chinese people are seeing these comments here but comments like ""fuck China"" here are the cause of such support of their country  and their authoritarian goverment (obviously economy seems to be a much bigger reason, but you already covered that). 

Not much different from some American people on this sub relate to the US. First step to nationalism is a strong relation to the country so your citizenship becomes personal identity. When people talk about the atrocities of US governments on this sub, a lot of American people show strong counter-reaction to that and reply with stuff like ""We aren't that bad"". ""We"" because of the said relation despite the fact that they haven't committed those actions. Anyway, those people on the sub would show even more harsh reaction &amp; commit to their image of the country even more if people said ""Fuck the US"" along with pointing out US history and present from a moral perspective. That comment would be downvoted to oblivion no matter the context for instance, on this sub it would. 

Anyway, from my limited perspective, the situation with Chinese ""nationalism"" is not much different. But they have a stronger relation to it in a vacuum due to differences in recent history of both countries.",nba

Like, Pat Connaughton also contributed positively last year. If we dropped him without replacing him with a comparable player, we would also be worse. But I guarantee people wouldn’t be losing their shit about how much of a mistake losing Pat Connaughton was.

Brogdon is most certainly a lot better than Connaughton, but the idea remains the same - he isn’t as good as people think he is, our system, coaching and depth is strong enough that we can approximate much of his value through other players on the team, and (not yet mentioned in this conversation but still relevant) we’re likely to improve in other areas through other acquisitions and progression from young players, so the impact of Brogdon leaving is going to be minimal.",nba

Fuck thats so disturbing. And China is so far along with advancements in their economies, technology, and military that it's going to take hundreds of years to even begin reversing/getting rid of that regime. And it can't really happen unless they start a war with the US. It would take so many resources to even attempt slowly changing the structure of their government that it's too risky for even first world countries to do anything. 

That's whats scarier about China to me than Russia. The impression I have about Russian citizens for the most part understand what Putin is, whether they agree with his policies or not are another thing.

But in China, these people literally do not because of how tyrannical their leaders are with information.

"Several interesting quotes here:

1) “We had the lineup with me, Gary and Jamal and Paul and he was there,” Jokic said. “We were just moving and cutting. He just didn’t know what to do. We told him, when you’re standing, you’re wrong. Whatever you do, just move.”

That’s exactly what Malone has told him.
“As we move the ball, he’s gotta understand cutting through the lane and finishing that cut and spotting back up, because the ball will find you,” Malone said. “That’s just how we play.”

2) “He’s a really good shooter, he can post up guys, he can go by guys, he’s a really talented player,” Jokic said. “We didn’t have a player like that just size-wise (last year). …  You can see he’s attacking the basket. He’s just going to the ball, like he’s bullying people. He’s gonna be really good.”

3) Porter knows his on-court development is a work in progress, which is why he’s unlikely to get the starting small forward job. His defense must improve substantially, and his feel for his new role will take time.",nba

There were like 2-3 plays though where he completely black holed on offense and ended up with a really bad shot, so that’s something to watch. But the rest of the game, he looked to move the ball and just waited for his opportunity to catch a lob or an open lane.",nba

"I’m on your side in this, there is no doubt that while Melo is an all time great scorer, that’s really where his excellence ends. His career ts is around 54% which is basically league average for the time he played in. Defensively he had a net negative dbpm nearly his entire career, and that is largely confirmed by the eye test as well. He was a solid rebounder, but at the expense of ditching his assignment to snag several of the defensive boards. However, he was an excellent offensive rebounder. I think during his prime, especially in New York he would have excelled if he had a more stable point guard to run the offense. Off the top of my head he played with Felton, Lin and Prigioni, and while all 3 had their moments none could provide the playmaking, shooting ability, and perimeter defense you need paired next to Melo. It seems like most people arguing for Melo only bring up counting stats to support their thesis, 25k club, # of all stars, and ppg. Which all of them are either subjective or do not tell the full story. My case for Paul George is that in nearly every category, excluding scoring, PG is far superior. First, on the defensive end, it all starts with willingness. PG is one of the most willing defenders we have in the league. He creates deflections and steals, and is among the league leaders in both categories year in year out. On this end of the floor he is a sturdy rebounder as well, grabbing 18% of defensive rebounds for his career. George can also guard 1-4, and has done so on several occasions when needed. On the attack, PG is levels above Melo in efficiency, which is the name of the game at this point. He hit a peak this past season in scoring volume, while I doubt he can top this in LA given the multitude of options, I wouldn’t say 25ppg is out of the question this season if healthy. PG also is a steady creator in the offense, though he will never be the primary assist man on any team, he is a willing passer and knows when to look for his shot, or defer to another. Overall, George has the more complete game that is fluid enough to adapt to any situation.",nba
"He’s a young player who was the first pick in the draft in 2017. But his first two seasons in the league were not good because it seemed like he forgot how to shoot or something, and his form looked terrible, but (from Wikipedia): 

&gt;	his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”.

I guess /r/nba just wants to see this kid comeback and live up to the hype that made him the first overall draft pick. It’s also kind of a meme to see him hit a jumper.",nba

"This is stupid, OP ask a question, ask to be convinced out of his answer to the question (which was not a question because OP post is shit) and then try to bash everyone that tell him otherwise.

So first comparing career when one isn't over is stupid.

then in every stupid question like this one, it depends on what you mean ... 

how do you judge a better career ? cause what i see from here is just you wanting to diss melo with a ""question"" (like you even start with no olympic shit lmao).

so i don't know what make a better career. i'll let you the useless talk about how pg has more x than melo and how melo has more y than PG. from what you wrote stats are so close for the 2 player that given the differences in context it can't means shit. Melo seems to have more individual trophies but PG career isn't over.

Then i saw you talk about playoffs success. Both have none. They went to a conf final, thats all you can say. If you want to compare it you would have to account for context and so i would once again be endless useless talk.

So what can we got from this. nothing for anyone with a brain. Cause they would already know that the question and your way to ask it is stupid. But you could understand that if you ask a question just to say your answer this is what you would get, no what you want and downvotes so you at least have an explanation for that

Now if you really want answers, make an other post, state how you define the criteria for career value and ranking then you'll have a discussion but you only went here in an attempt for validation you clearly don't want to listen to people if they don't say the same as you are ...

edit : funny how OP would claim that ""all these downvoted but nobody can tell me how Melo has had a better career than PG"" but my post was downvoted 5s after it was posted but with what he wrote it defenitly can't be op right ?",nba

"imo aswell CP3 is a point god we all know this, but the dantoni offense requires the particular seven second type style as a \*first look\*. Harden is a good enough PG to slow the game down and run half sets if he needs to fulfilling what Cp3 did there, but Russ fits better into the fast pace philosophy of D'Antoni more naturally then Cp3 did.   


The big thing imo is off ball movement which he's been okay with early in his career but got worse with, I think that's all about putting in the hardwork to change the habits he's built but he can do it.",nba
"&gt;I literally just chose some of the guards he matched up with the most across possessions

Yeah, and you understand there's a very clear bias here right?

Simmons isn't matching up often against the guards he struggles against. 

When looking at Kemba's most frequent matchups: 

* Rajon Rondo (held to 40%)
* Eric Bledsoe (held to 45%, averaged 56% for the season)
* D'Aaron Fox (held to 32%) 

I guess by your logic we should be putting Kemba on Curry? 

&gt;He hasn't shown that capacity because he hasn't been assigned to Kemba full-time at all, specifically because Sixers teams in the past needed to have Redick guard the small players or he'd get bullied by the bigger ones.

Against a team like Charlotte, this isn't really a concern at all. They run plenty of smaller guards to match Redick onto. 

At 6'4, Redick is right in between Lamb (6'5) and Monk (6'3).",nba

"I think the point in favor of Jarrett Allen is that he's much more important in the future of the franchise, the Nets won't be in full gear until a year from now when Kevin Durant comes back, and DJ's complete lack of any kind of lateral movement makes him a liability in a lot of matchups.

"I think the comments the Toronto players made that Kawhi played with such calmness and confidence it helped buoy them when they might otherwise succumb mental pressures. I’m not sure Butler or PG can provide that.

Of course as a Spurs fan, I have a bit of dislike to Kawhi but I can’t deny that he has really worked hard on a lot of facets of his game and improved each year adding new facets. As such I think there is a bit of daylight between Kawhi and Butler/PG.

Kwahi had a great supporting cast, especially in light of the players missing from the Warriors lineup and role players like Van Fleet really stepped up and made a huge difference.",nba

"Seth Curry was an unfortunate loss for us and probably our biggest out of the ones you mentioned. Aminu was a loss, but not unrecoverable. However, losing Turner is *not* that bad... I loved the dude but I really did not like watching him shoot unreliable turnaround midrange fadeaway jumpers every game. Plus the addition of Nas Little will take some of Turner's minutes and we will be able to develop that young talent.

Meyers Leonard was not a loss for us at all, either. He only played ~14mpg and contributed 1 three pointer a game. His minutes will be absorbed by Collins and Whiteside, two players who I would far rather want to play intead. 

The relatively long-term members of that core who went to the Conf. Finals were not significant contributors, and I think we actually improved our roster in terms of impactful players from last year to now.

Brogdon is good and I agree letting him go was a mistake, but SECOND BEST PLAYER? He cannot create his own shot and does not attempt any contested 3s, but you say he can based on Bucks games you watched? Give me a single game where he created his own shot consistently. Not a game where he always benefited from Giannis, Bledsoe, Middleton — heck, even Lopez — drawing the attention of the defense.

It doesn’t make people’s issues with Trump or Duerte go away just because Adolf Hitler is worse. It’s a whataboutism and it’s logically fallacious no matter how many sources you cite.

Curious: he probably won’t travel to Toronto again this year right?,nba
"My point is that knowing perimeter defense is a weakness of Lillard and McCollum, I""m not sure Bazemore will be enough to replace the loss of Turner and Aminu. 

Collins isn't great at 3s but projects as your starting 4, and Whiteside as your starting 5. So you have no defense in your backcourt and no shooting in your frontcourt, with question marks on the wing depth. 

I love Stotts and I think he can make it work, but there was a familiarity and chemistry with the unit last year that allowed it to exceed the sum of it's parts. When you take that away, the parts don't necessarily add up to strong playoff team on paper.",nba

"I have never said brogdon is better or more valuable than Blessoe and I really don’t care, I’m just glad brogdon is a pacer! but something that the stats don’t really show is..

Brogdon will be 27 most of the year going into his 4th season and has been improving every year.

Bledsoe will be 30 most of the year and going into his 11th season and his counting stats have actually dropped off a bit with a very clear prime from around 2014-17.

I also think usuage plays a big role. I don’t have stats to back it up but the games I watched it seemed like bledsoe had the ball in his hands more often which will lead to more assists as well as turn overs.

Also was it really ever Brogdon vs Bledsoe? I thought if the bucks signed Brogdon it meant a heavy tax or no Middleton so I don’t get why everyone is so stuck on this.",nba

I remember going to the Knicks/Thunder game the night after that crazy Sixers/Thunder 3OT game in Philly (the one where Russ waves goodbye to Embiid).  The Thunder were deadfooted all game; it was obvious they had nothing in the tank and were conceding the game to the Knicks.  Everyone except Russ.  He was the only one who gave great energy and effort throughout the game.  I still remember [this dunk] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V4cftH9c4U) and wondering how he had any legs left.

"&gt;  Just because Gulen is also bad does not act as a defense for the bad shit Ergodan does.

Where the fuck did I defend Erdogan. Yall have no idea what whataboutism means and it's a favorite of people who just don't want to admit that the choice that they defend is also a shitty one. If there are three people and two of them are shit and they dislike each other, should I support one just because? Nonsense. 

Read the definition of whataboutism.

&gt; discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument

I agree with Kanter that Erdogan is bad, but guess what, I also don't support his choice either. If you think that's whataboutism, I guess you just want a reality where we only have binary choices and thinking outside of those two choices shouldn't be allowed. Americans have already adopted that model, you should instill it in Canada.

The Duerte, Trump, Hitler comparison is also not apt and honestly idiotic. If Duerte or Trump was facing Hitler in an election, that would make sense as a comparison since they are all involved in the same event. But btw, who would you pick if Hitler, Pol Pot, and Kim Jung Il were all running in the same election. You got to pick one and you can't say anything bad about them since that's whataboutism.",nba
You'd be jumping off your right leg as a righty. Basically start his stepback but go into a jumpshot after the first foot goes back instead of both. Perhaps he's using it to throw off defender's timing because they jump at the stepback and that lets him draw easy fouls?,nba

Jaren also was 19 and grew almost 2 inches and added some muscle so that should help with rebounding and foul trouble which are his only major flaws. I'm taking a 7 footer who can shoot threes and switch on to smaller defenders while also being a great shot blocker.

You are right but it was on both ends. They game planned towards Harden switching onto Lebron/Wade.

"There's actually a analytics reason why players who shoot significantly above 40% are very rare. 

From a basic maths perspective, if the points per possession on one of your shots is better than the team average, the team should be trying to get you more shots. 

The league-leading Milwaukee Bucks had an offensive rating of 113.5, which translates to 1.135 points per possession. Disregarding fouls and turnovers, this suggests that if you shoot better than ~38% from 3, no matter what team you play on, your team should be trying to find you more 3 point attempts.

As a result, players who shoot above those numbers are generally either catch and shoot specialists (in which case it might be hard for the team to generate more attempts, since it puts a burden on the playmaker), players who played before the analytics movement developed this understanding, or Steph Curry, who shoots well above this mark even when creating his own shot at a high volume as the focal point of an elite offense.",nba

&gt;That's what happened in this situation. Lebron previously made a deep 3 late in the shot clock and he was going to launch again so they doubled him.

What happened was he scored and they were down and wanted to mix things up. They ended up forcing a tough fadeaway from Kuzma and were able to get out in transition. It wasn’t about him specifically hitting a deep 3, it was more of a strategically timed double",nba

Did you just literally define exploitation (WHICH ISN'T SUBJECTIVE. IT'S A WORD WITH A MEANING, LIKE ALL WORDS) then say you disagree with the definition, which you were kind enough to give? Please find the correct word/phrasing for whatever you're thinking because exploitation is taken. Thanks for ending that argument for us. 

It feels to me that you believe that the value added to society by doctor's isn't properly represented in how they're accommodated for the skills they have that add that value? Correct? And that they add arguably the most (I'd say teachers, but that's some chicken and the egg shit with one keeping the other alive to learn from him how to keep him alive), which is why you feel they're ""exploited"" the most?

It's not a scale. You are either exploited under capitalism or exploiting others. That's the economic system. That's how it runs. This is where good vs evil comes in (since the whole thread started over the idea that there are no good billionaires, idk why you'd try to dismiss the topic of the conversation).

If you are exploiting others to pay your bills, I can not, and will not, be able to think of you as good. But I won't think of you as even slightly evil unless you prove otherwise. (Honestly, most people just *are* to me. I know like 5 genuinely good people and like 2 genuinely evil irl.) But it shows such a lack of awareness of the world around you and the struggles the exploited workers, from every sector, face every day if you don't look in the mirror with disgust at putting money in your wallet off the hard work of other people.

Why does he needs friends in the NBA? If they weren't bound together by being in the NBA do you honestly believe he would be friends with other players?

"That's mostly because they just didn't care in the regular season, and they were not concerned about the Clippers at all in that first playoff series. When Golden State wanted to lock you down on defense, they did.

Losing Iguodala and Klay for most of the season is going to mess up everything they do on defense this year. They can't switch everything anymore. They don't have a death lineup. It's going to be a struggle.

I don't know what Klay is going to look like when he comes back this season. I can't exactly just assume he's going to be great like usual. If Klay is close to normal though, I think GS can be decent defensively. I just don't think this roster can be dominant.

Then offensively it's going to be a struggle to put the ball in the basket when Curry is off the floor. Theoretically, DLo helps in that he gives them a primary ball handler and playmaker when Steph sits. They never had that before. However, DLo and pieces isn't going to get you a great offense.

I'm betting you see a lot of Steph playing with bench units this year because apparently you can slot Curry into any lineup and have a top 5 offense. That way, it gives DLo more threats in the floor and balances things out.",nba

"The quant funds that actually make money would take a PHD in physics without a CFA over a PHD in physics with a CFA anyday.  If you don't know that, you're the fool.  Prestigious doesn't mean valuable lol, have fun wiping your ass in 10 years with it as it loses pretty much all its value though, while my CPA generates me hundreds of thousands a year through little effort.

CFA part 1 and 2 is a joke btw lol, I helped my friends study for it and it was laughable how fucking easy it was.  Part 3 involves some math that makes it somewhat harder than the CPA i'll give you that, but it really isn't that hard.

Thinking that CPA's are number janitors is hilarious though.  Its probably as relevant to CPAs as my experience with dumbass CFAs.  Only someone who truly doesn't know what they're talking about thinks that CPA's aren't extremely valuable in the finance world, as well as the business world.  You clearly don't know very many smart CPAs which is fine, because neither do I and thats why I do so well for myself.

By the way i'm also a software engineer and write software that is way harder to make than passing the CFA is, as well as way more valuable.  And thanks to the stupidity of many CPA's its easy as shit to make money handoverfist with creating Accounting software and running my own business using it.  So i'm happy that your experience with CPAs validates my own, as it shows that even though i'm making a lot of money now, I have plenty of room for massive growth :)

"""You are either exploited under capitalism or exploiting others"" that is just not fucking true at all lmao.  I run my own SaaS business with a partner, we both own 50% of our company and have 0 employees.  We provide a service and software that is cheaper than all our competitors, to the point where we've massively expanded the overall market for our product to include those in the low and middle income classes (from which they make money using our product, not losing it).

So please tell me how i'm being exploited, or how i'm exploiting others?  After all, you said its a binary condition of capitalism, with absolutely no middle ground.  So explain to me how that is occuring for my situation?

Also you do realize in my first comment, I literally talked about how I don't think billionaires are evil IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY AMERICANS BASIC NEEDS ARE MET.  If you want to try and extrapolate that to the world, you are missing nuance that has nothing to do with capitalism, and everything to do with corrupt governments (We sent tons of money to Haiti, almost none of it went to the people who we tried to help with it, that isn't capitalism's fault, thats the corrupt governments fault).

I don't think that doctor pay is the problem, I'm actually writing a book on the vast problems in our healthcare system (almost all of which aren't addressed by any plan put out by any candidate including medicare for all), that explains it, and i'm not getting into that argument right now.  The only thing i'll say about it is that our government has kept the supply of doctors low (they capped residency funding at 1996 levels under the 1996 balanced budget act).  They're exploited heavily by the government, patients, health insurance companies, employers, and other doctors.  Its a very complex and nuanced system, and increasing payment to even 10 million a year won't stop the fact that they're being exploited still.


Making a profit off of others hard work isn't inherently evil or wrong, there are certainly many cases where it happens, but the fundamental concept of making a profit off of other peoples hard work doesn't automatically equal exploitation or that you're a bad person, or that you should feel bad about it.",nba

"A LOT of subjective imagination here but IMO:

* Kobe is the better shooter. I am going to make this argument a lot but if he was raised in this era I think his 3pt shooting would be a lot better. He didn't make it a focus until his Achilles tore, he relied on the midrange 2 his whole career. My basis for this would be his excellent FT% on massive volume.

* My argument at the beginning is Lebron is better around the rim because he's bigger. SUBJECTIVE but I believe Kobe has more creative finishes and is better with his footwork on finishes..how would we ever tell who is more 'skilled'? My guess is Kobe but I see why many go Lebron.

* The most debatable one: IMO Lebron is better at passing but not that much more than Kobe. Again if Kobe grew up in this league I think he would be much better. I think where most argue Lebron excels is making the reads and the cross court passes; but was that kind of play prevalent when Kobe was young? IMO the early 2000s was characterized by clogged lanes, no shooting, and ISO basketball; all that means Kobe never adopted any of this into his playstyle. And sure enough he retained his 'scorer mentality' but we saw so many flashes of cerebral reads and game adjustments.

Again to sum up I give Lebron the slight nod in passing but in every other category I like Kobe better.",nba

I think losing Lamb and not having a replacement for him hurts more. I think losing Parker, despite limitations last year, hurts some. I even think losing Kaminsky, despite having more limitations, hurts. This is a team that will rely on Rozier, Bridges, Monk, and Batum.. and maybe Zeller if he can last for more than half a season. Doesn't look good to me.

I also think some of the competition around and under them last year got better. Miami looks like a playoff team now. Orlando is rolling it back and they look to be a lock for a lower seed. The Nets look like a solid mid seed instead of a mid-season-maybe. Detroit looks about the same for good or worse. Atlanta, Chicago, and even the Knicks all look better than they did last year and at least one of those teams could push for a bottom seed.

"He's worked on it and refined it over the off-season.  He even got a respectable defender like Danny Green with it.  He's just using this occasionally in order to enter it into the defenders' calculus to have them thinking about one more thing where he'll have a counter to it by not gathering and continuing into a drive.  He shown in pick-up games time and time again that it has it's use.  It's not something that will be as pervasive as the stepback obviously but he's gotten it down to where shooting off one foot like Dirk, KD but just a different iteration is reducing the variability to his shooting movement (one foot needs to be in sync rather than two) which some argue results in a straighter shot.  I don't think it will be as popular for other players to take on like the eurostep, stepback, and side step shots because of difficult of coordination but Harden is always working on something.  The third shot is something CP3 does.  It's working on having a pocketless shot (i.e., no shot pocket) that Donovan Mitchell raved about when talking abotu CP3.  Basically if you don't have just a single pocket that you can shoot from then that makes you even more unpredictable and able to get a shot off without performing all sorts of contingent set-up into a shot to be in rhythm.",nba

"&gt;Mix that with poor mechanics from the time and if you're not doing something like fading and shooting on the downward of your shot (as wilt does in the highlights shown), you're going to shoot too strong and shoot long most of the time

He actually did try shooting free throws as fadeaways. He also tried bank shots from off-cemter. And underhanded (which was among his best, but not as good as Gladwell thinks), and from a couple feet back. I wonder if he had just tried one style and tied to get that to 65% he'd be fine.

One of the biggest things I struggled with was admitting that I even had stuff that was bothering me, always said ""it's not a huge deal but..."" or ""I know other people have it worse but..."". And I ended up just spilling my guts for an hour straight the first session and had to step back and say ""whoa, there's a lot here"". Now it's a highlight of my week.

"It was noteworthy on Mavs Media Day bc when Stein sent out the tweet about the NBA tightening up heights, Dirk tweeted out a joke about JJ.

So media day arrived and it was fresh on the mind of Dallas media. JJ came in at 5-10. Since the Mavs also have the two tallest players on the roster (Boban, Porzingis), the media cared to find out who was really taller.  

Thus, it became more of a story there in Dallas than other places. There had also been great debate about Doncic’s true size, so that’s where the tweet derived from. Townsend was saying that the *old* heights were listed on the roster given to those media people on Media Day, but he got the true height from players/staff when interviewing them. 

Here’s the original:

&gt;On media notes, official team roster, etc, Doncic still will be listed at 6-7. Likewise, even though Porzingis measured at 7-2 and three-quarters he'll be listed at 7-3. Heights will be rounded to the nearest inch. Biggest Mavs change will be Barea, who goes from 6-0 to 5-10.",nba

There were also a lot of guys clumped together towards the bottom.  So in 1 season Lebron went from not being on the list to passing 7 of the players on it.

"NYK fans need an outside scapegoat for their own impotent shittiness and KP is a perfect foil.

Guy gets booed simply for getting drafted and fans are shocked -- SHOCKED! -- when he wants to leave ASAP. The owner bans franchise legends for criticizing him. His GM made him deal with constant trade rumors, and the next GM wouldn't offer him a max extension. His coach tells his best buddy to tell him to ""stop playing like a pussy."" Gets locked out of the practice gym in the cold (which is like an hours drive across the city). His best teammate besides a rapidly depreciating Melo was like...Tim Hardaway Jr.?, losing record season after season, revolving door of coaches and scrub teammates...

The kind of competence like trading your franchise superstar to open cap space for superstars who don't come (and you don't even apparently make an offer for) plus expecting to win a &lt; 14% chance at Zion...it's a franchise run by chickens with their heads cut off.

Even afterwards, The Knicks front office did an excellent job throwing Porzingis under the bus while KP just thanked NY fans and kept his mouth shut.

But, no it's Porzingis's fault for wanting the hell out.

I wish people would stop comparing Porzingis to AD or Kawhi or any of the other stars forcing their way out of teams that were actually doing everything they could possibly do to keep them happy. Plus, AD and Kawhi voluntarily agreed to stay with their previous franchises before changing their minds and forcing their way out, while KP had no choice but to play for the crappy team who drafted him.",nba

Harden and CP3 meshed pretty well. The offense operated at a very high level when both were on the floor together, and when just one was on the floor at a time. 

Just because CP3s stats were lower relative to his career averages has nothing to do with his fit next to Harden. It has to do with the fact he was playing a different role.",nba

The data can be found on his basketball-reference page just after “advanced” under “shooting.”  B-ball reference doesn’t have data for 0-5 ft or for 3-5ft, but really the 0-3 ft range they provide is the best range for “finishing at the rim.”",nba

"I think this is a useful move for Harden specifically in the right corner, or right wing.  Three reasons:

1.  Teams will always force him right from that vantage point, and essentially concede this shot (fadeaway drifting right is unblockable with defender on his left hip).

2.  He doesn't need as much range on this shot as he would at the top of the key, since it's the 22 foot corner three.

3.  If Russell is running the show up top, and Harden can shoot this shot at a ~35% clip or higher, that's a pretty big deal, because it means that he can conserve a ton of energy just standing in the right corner for some possessions while Russell runs the show.  Obviously he would have his typical role when Russ is out of the game or gassed.",nba

I watched him play when he was in high school he played what was then known as the round ball classic.

Calvin led the US team out in warmups and dunked hard and the crowd went crazy he went on to score like 30 I have always enjoyed watching him play.,nba

If anything it’s probably a boost to him hearing how sore a rival team was about losing out on him.

I mean, these past 10 years have been a culture shock to me in relation how the Clippers used to be treated by the Lakers and their fans. They used to never even pay mind to the Clippers; they genuinely were undisturbed by the Clippers’ existence. Like, who even wants to talk about the Clippers, they didn’t have any positive or hostile thoughts about them. They just didn’t think about them other than for cheap tickets to games.

"Everyone should agree that the Heat were his first superteam. You'd have to have some kind of neurological impairment to think otherwise, so we can agree there. His next stop for his second stint with the Cavs was also a superteam. Kyrie was already a two time All Star and he made the All NBA team in his first season with LeBron. What he did in terms of All NBA and All Star selections *while playing with LeBron* is as significant to the argument than what he did prior. Kevin Love was a 3 time All Star and 2 time All NBA player before joining the Cavs, not to mention a consensus top 3 power forward in the league. People forget his record double double  streak, being the first player to have a 30-30 game in so long etc. That guy was a legitimate star in the league. Add a top 2 player of all time and that is damn well a superteam. Two of the four years those three played together *all three* made the All Star team in the same year. Again, you'd have to have some kind of mental deficiency to think that doesn't constitute a superteam. You don't *need* to have two top five players to have a superteam. The loose definition is usually more along the lines of having three All Star caliber players in the same team ie a Big Three.              
As for the Lakers, well they have two top 5 players so that is certainly a superteam.",nba

"If my model spit out Jason Collins as the 20th best playoff performer of the last 20+ years I would re-check my assumptions and methodology.

Meanwhile Dwight Howard, who has the 19th highest WS/48 over this time frame (min 1000 playoff minutes), with averages of 18/14/2.5 on 59% from the field is ranked 710th in RAPM.

If your definition of greatest only encompasses “most innovative” then yeah he could be the greatest. It’s the Citizen Kane problem, by far the most innovative and influential movie of all time, however on its and own and without the context of what it was in grand scheme of things it barely stands up to stuff shot nowadays in terms of entertainment value and story telling (although it’s still a great movie on its own).",nba

"boom, another stat used by people like you trying too hard to swing the pendulum the other way

raptors were 4-5 againsts teams over .500.. every other win was against lower level squads, apart from blowing the warriors out &amp; some other good team i’m forgetting

kawhi &amp; raptors staff chose games he wouldn’t be needed",nba
dam that’s crazy,nba
Why not both?,nba
Is Kyrie shooting with his left?,nba
Hotdog stand around the corner lol,nba
"NBA contracts are just like that. Top role players get max or near max deals because the money in the NBA is astronomical and there aren’t that many guys you have to pay. His deal is manageable because the King’s star players are on rookie deals rn. They’ll have flexibility when they have to pay Fox and Bagley. 

SF is also a premium position and the King’s had a glaring hole there last season hence why they traded for him. He’s a solid 3rd or 4th option that can hit 3’s, create in late shot clock scenarios when necessary, moves the ball well. He’s also a solid, versatile defender that can switch to multiple positions.

He was a let down in Dallas but he’s just not a number 1 scoring option. Dallas had to pay someone though and struck out on every big free agent that season . He kept a bad Dallas team from being the worst team in the league and still got their guy in Luka with him being the Tank captain.",nba
Every single MVP that's been HOF eligible has made it in. There's nothing to prove it doesn't.,nba
"You should be appreciative. He gave you guys the only championship your team might ever have. As for PG, feel as you wish.",nba
"I get ur point.. just put across mine.. I value defence much more than offence. So my opinion is biased.. the all time argument leans towards harden solely bcz of his regular season accomplishments and his offensive output.. kawhi is never going to have the numbers...

As to ur 2nd point, I'm not comparing their performances agst each other.. I'm saying harden beat the warriors with KD in the regular season but couldn't beat the warriors without KD in the playoffs... No knock on harden.. just wished he had stood up (like lbj does again and again) and took the rockets to the finals.. 

Then we would have an actual kawhi vs harden debate..",nba
"Sure, but scale matters. There are just way more kids going through that now.",nba
You on a losing streak.,nba
"each position has a different background

basketball analyst have a college computer science degree or statistics  and come from target schools

some start as coaches before moving to the front office

scouts usually start as a scout for a college team and transfer over eventually

and gm's usually come from one of the former mentioned backgrounds or as a player agent",nba
"Athletes/celebs are a whole different thing though, I get why Kawhi would choose to leave. Homie is acting like LA shits on Toronto in every way possible which is far from the truth. Might be overreacting but people don't know how/don't want to believe how sick Toronto is",nba
"The one clipper fan I know is this exactly.

I’m a Lakers Rams Ducks Angels but fuck baseball honestly.",nba
"That's exactly my point. Which is why it's unfair to discredit Spo for having him. Spo maximized Lebron, took him to his absolute peak, built a team around insane efficiency and the best defense, and revolutionized the NBA by popularizing small ball and ""inverted offense.""

Spo is top 3. People who put Stevens up there are a joke",nba
I remember seeing a [documentary about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXmoYOc9ZZw),nba
Anthony Davis when he realized how horrible the lakers are.,nba
kawhi will find out that the raptors were actually exceptional in their load management plan and that he wont get that kind of treatment in la. Pair that with the booing he will get every home game and the fact that the team wont autowin games without both him and george on the court and he would demand a trade back to toronto,nba
"I'd say it pretty much died down here in Montreal. Since Calvillo left, the team sucks and the stadium is always empty.

"He ""daggered"" Hardens Rockets in 2014. Harden has significantly improved since then and had consistently played at a higher level than Dame for years at this point.

No disrespect to Dame because Dame is great, but I don't really see your point. He's not on the level that Harden is and has been for a few years now. I just feel like you are being disingenuous.",nba
"Put it this way. If I offered you a million bucks to find someone with a Clippers jersey in la within a day, you would lose.",nba

"Curry #332 defense, shits rough out there.",nba
Oh so you just want to watch an all-star game. I hate all-star games because theres no defense and players don't try. So that's the problem.,nba
They will split starts. Allen gets outmuscled very easily by guys like Embiid/Drummond and Deandre will help in those matchups.,nba
"Refereeing, hand signs, cheering, taunting, posing, trash talking, whining and the occasional pretending to want to get into a fight",nba
Even my grandma didnt give me that much candies.,nba
"eh a lot of players also enjoy it. It fuels them knowing they have haters like that. Some players manage to play better in those conditions and may even hype up the hate train. They can perceive it as envy oppose to hate. Nonetheless these type of professionals usually go through some kind of training class when it comes to crowds and hate/booing.  
  
At the end of the day i think it comes down to how emotionally responsive you are vs how logically responsive you are. I would reckon that Kawhi is more on the logical responsive side so it shouldn't really have an affect on him",nba

It is the largest by population, though.",nba

"clowns in here really acting like kawhi didn’t put that entire team on his back for two straight rounds because fred vanvleet showed up curry and siakam had a great g1

Every player would rather a championship than an MVP award.,nba
"&gt; and you know they’re doing it to some other hard working athlete right now.

Yeah, for sure. I think in the 60 Minutes piece, it was mentioned that the refs, some of them at least, were bitter about how much more money the players made than them. Sounded like the refs acted like some cops, with their own code and vendettas, feeling like they personified correct basketball and whatever they did was by virtue of coming from them, the right call. Also, a lot of them were betting on games according to the guy.",nba
"People sleeping on the Warriors lol, y'all forget that after the 2016 finals before they signed KD they were betting favorites? now obviously the team has a much shittier bench then 2016 but god damn they got D'Lo, they're gonna be good.",nba

"Inside play? The game was tied, all they needed was any form of a point. If PG played lillard too close, he is at risk opening up a vast more amount of moves lillard has in his arsenal such as a blow by for a lay up or a step back from a much closer range than 30+ footer

So Unless you’re saying lillard shoots better the further away from the basket than he is at close, just from a shot probability stand point, it just makes no sense to risk playing up for something that’s a much more higher chance of making. Which is the majority of my original point.",nba

"&gt;Size

They're both pretty average height/weight for their position, not really saying much here.

&gt;shooting

Larry is a member of the 50/40/90 club sharpshooter club, Luka shot below league average in both FTs and 3% - something Bird has never done. In what way is that similar...?

&gt;playmaking

Larry was such a good playmaker/facilitator his first season that he turned the losing record Celtics in deep playoff contenders his rookie season. Luka is a good playmaker, especially for a rookie, but Larry was elite his very first season.

&gt; lack of athleticism

Larry has above-average athleticism, especially for his team. People always assume Larry's not athletic because they compared him to Magic but he had a VERY good rim finishing ability because of agility along with his IQ. He was definitely above average. Luka isn't.

&gt;good handle but not flashy.

"&gt;okay not multiple tiers

I really don't see the issue here. I feel like most people here don't actually comprehend just how large the gap is. 

We can safely ignore playmaking, because Harden is definitely in a different league compared to PG in terms of court control. 

If we compare just scoring, Harden averaged 36 ppg at an elite TS 62%. PG averaged 28 ppg at a very good TS 58%. Harden isn't only scoring 8 more points than PG, he is doing it at a better efficiency too. 

Now, if someone goes from scoring 17 points per game to 25 points per game, we would say that player went from a good role player to a potential offensive star (depending on age of course). However, going from 17ppg to 25ppg is something we already see often. On the other hand, going from 28 to 36 is also 8 points, but significantly harder. Fatigue sets in and defensive pressure steps up, at that point that gap is literally the difference between the best scorer in the league versus a great scorer in the league. 

Multiple tiers is absolutely not an overstatement. Harden had arguably the best scoring season ever in the modern day NBA, surpassing any of Kobe's scoring seasons and rivaling MJ's best scoring season.",nba

"Overrated: 
Brogdon. I love the guy but people take his 50/40/90 season and assume he’s one of the best shooters in the league. He’s good, but one of the reasons his 3pt% is so high is because he never really took any contested threes. His playmaking is decent, but he has tunnel vision and doesn’t have the dribbling skills to be the main playmaker on the floor. His defense in the playoffs wasn’t as solid as it was on previous seasons, but he was coming off an injury so I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.


He’s still a good shooter and is really great at driving and finishing, but people kind of inflate his skill just because he played okay and made timely shots vs the Raptors. I’m still high on him though and he can still improve on the Pacers


Underrated: 
Ben Simmons honestly. Yes he doesn’t have a jumper but people really discredit how good he is despite his limited offensive game. He’s a great finisher and is always a threat driving to the rim, not to mention his insane passing ability. He’s versatile enough on defense to guard 1-4 as well. He just doesn’t have the perfect team around him to showcase his skills because he‘s best with shooters around him to spread the floor, and that might make people see him as worse than he is.",nba

They can work regular jobs for regular salaries like everyone else in the world. If they want to play in the NBA, they have to live with the circumstances, which means that in order for the NBA to have some semblance of competition and parity (which frankly, there isn’t much of in the league) is to allow teams to have contracts that can be enforced and allow teams some kind of stability. Every other job/company in the world has a set of operating procedures that employees have to agree to in order to work there. But somehow it’s the athletes that are oppressed for having to do the same thing?

The only 14 year old mentality is the one where you are so star struck by your favorite athletes that you convince yourself that they are being oppressed by “anti-progressives” with a “slave”-like mentality because they believe they should be required to carry out the details of the contract they signed in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars.

"He didn't play in the NBA, but the tallest basketball player in international play was even taller than this—Suleiman Ali Nashnush, who apparently played for Libya in the 60s at 8'0. According to his (very short and sketchily sourced) Wikipedia article he was actually closer to your exact number, 7'10, by the time he played professionally. 

All that said, there is no footage of Nashnush playing basketball and I can't find a photo of it, either, though I could have sworn I saw one as a kid. And Libya doesn't appear to have qualified for any major tournaments in 1962 (the year he's supposed to have played for their national team) or 1963 (the year of the FIBA championships), although there was at least a national team at that point. So I'm not sure how much basketball he actually played. [Alexander Sizonenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Sizonenko), who played at a high level in the Soviet Union and on their national team in the 80s, was also listed at 7'10-7'11 during his career and is much easier to verify.",nba

"Brogdon’s a good one. Basketball fans are weird. We idolize completely arbitrary statistics like 50-40-90, for example someone like Curry is vastly more efficient than Brogdon despite not really reaching 50% field goal percentage because he takes so many more threes that it lowers his overall fg% but his overall TS% is much higher. 


What Brook Lopez did last year was more impressive than Brogdon. Give me 6 and a half, 3-pointers a game on 36% shooting over 4.3, 3 pointers a game on 42%. Math says Lopez is more valuable as a shooter.

And Yea- Ben Simmons is really underrated. He’s in a weird spot where he’s not really a star- but also overqualified to be a role player- and he has one of the more peculiar playstyles.

"The reductionist logic makes no sense in this case. The caveats are already laid out there. Championships alone are meaningless, but individual success combined with championships make perfect sense for comparison. I feel like r/NBA is always on this dick-riding “championship comparisons don’t make sense”. We all know which championships matter and which ones make sense to compare for players. Similarly, context matters, and you and the rest of r/NBA like to ignore it in favor of counting numbers and efficiency stats and advanced metrics that clearly can be corrected for, but ultimately culminate in 0 actual achievement.

It’s like the case of Olympic runners. Have people gotten that much faster in the single generation? That much better nutrition? No, it’s been shown that the vast majority of improvement from the earliest Olympic events is a result of environmental changes — better shoes, less wind, tighter and more aerodynamic clothing, better ground, etc.

Same thing for basketball.

I’m not going to bother responding to the overplayed Shaq bit. No one cares how much Kobe memorabilia you claim to have on the internet. “I’m not racist, my best friends are black” is no more valid in basketball than it is anywhere else.

In that series Giannis and Middleton performed like the two best players, and they still lost.",nba

"The West is just too deep for me to say that not making the playoffs would mean the Mavs season was not a success.

"""Morals go out the window when the teams do things explicitly allowed in voluntarily signed contracts"" really sums up the reflexive ""I love famous celebrities and I want new stuff on my phone all the time"" mindset that a chunk of this sub is into.  They really don't.  If a team found a contract loophole that allowed them to only have a $50,000 fine if they refused to pay a player's contract, I'm sure the attitude here would be markedly different.  Viewing this like some sort of ""justice"" issue on par with blue collar labor is comical, and the comparison falls apart completely.  At least in some cases, players and their agents are  doing things detrimental to the teams, teammates, and fanbases that are explicitly prohibited, and saying ""well, the teams should have written slicing the tongues out of the players if they really wanted them to follow the rules"" is not even vaguely convincing.",nba

"In 08/09 the cavs won 66 games, made it to the ECF, had a second all star averaging just under 20 a night and had capable role players that helped form the 3rd best defence and 4th best offence in the league. But then in the playoffs the talent around the star collapsed, sometimes role players can only get you so far. 

I think a lot of superstars eventually just want second superstars, the bucks have done an amazing job at fielding a team around Giannis without a second one, but if they get bounced again because the role players impact doesn't translate in the playoffs, I wouldn't be surprised if history repeated itself",nba

Defensively brown is certainly better, but honestly I think he’s pretty overrated on that end. He looks like he should be elite, and his on-ball defense is really strong, so this leads people to believe he’s a little better than he is. His team defense though leaves a lot to be desired.

"&gt;Eric Bledsoe is 29. This is his prime. If he’s not good enough now, he won’t be in two years. Bledsoe has got to show something this upcoming year in the playoffs.

Yeah it's a problem if he shits the bed in the playoffs again no doubt about it. However it's not like being 29 means the mental side of your game starts declining. He's not a great shooter by any stretch but he isn't 17% from 3 bad either. If he even just shot closer to his regular season 33% instead of 17% it would have been a different series vs. TOR. In terms of defense, finishing at the rim, and taking care of the ball he had the best year of his career and I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that he can't expand on that or get over his playoff yips.

&gt;Brook Lopez is 31. Same goes for him. He’s not gonna get any better these next two years. 

Why does Lopez need to get better? He's already an amazing fit with Giannis and I don't really see why his game would decline significantly if at all from now until when he's 33. Trailing in transition and parking behind the 3-point line is most of his offense, and on defense he mostly just plays drop coverage. To say his game isn't dependent on athleticism is an understatement. 

&gt;George hill is 33. Hill is already on the decline but is still a very valuable role player. But in two years? He’s likely not gonna be of much help. 

The Hill contract makes me uneasy a couple years down the road I agree, but I seriously doubt it'd be untradeable and become the deciding factor in whether we bring someone else in or not. Plus I do really like him as a Bledsoe insurance policy.

&gt;Ersan Ilyasova is 32. He’s a role player now and in two years likely won’t be getting any meaningful minutes. 

He's only guaranteed for this upcoming season, not really important. Also he's probably 35 lol

&gt;I know a lot of people and almost all bucks fans take any post about why Giannis would leave as hate but I don’t get how u couldn’t be concerned.

We're not concerned because Giannis is two years from free agency and there really isn't any point in bring concerned about it. If he leaves then he leaves. We've put a really good team around him and it has a great chance to make that Finals appearance that you feel is a necessary condition for him staying, so we just wanna enjoy it. 

&gt;It’s a real tough spot for the bucks to be in but they did contribute to this somewhat by choosing not to keep brogdon. 

I ultimately wish we kept Brogdon, but you know those cap issues with Middleton and Giannis on a supermax? Not overpaying a guy who wanted a bigger role elsewhere, avoiding the repeater tax, and getting picks back is a fine way of mitigating whatever damage might come about from letting him go - which I really don't think will be as much as people make it sound sometimes.

&gt;Basically my opinion on this is if the bucks don’t make a finals appearance in these next two years they got no shot to keep giannis cause their will be no upside for him to stay.

Besides the whole supermax thing where he'd get the biggest contract any player has ever signed. 

Honestly if we're following your logic to it's conclusion, not even winning a Finals would keep him here and we might as well just trade him now.",nba

Giannis has taken big steps in improving his game every year so far in his career. I would put money on the bucks to make the finals come 2020 season. However even if they do make the finals I can see Giannis leave. The bucks overall lack star power and in today’s nba that’s a big difference maker.,nba

However, given that this hypothetical player would make the current ruleset of basketball utterly outdated, my guess is that they'd let him run rampant for a single season before doing some serious overhauls to maintain the competitive aspect of the game (otherwise the finals devolves into ""who can convince this player to play for them in FA?"").

"Thing is, all of that stuff is ""source close to the Knicks"" or ""sources say"" or ""anonymous source close to Anthony."" I'm sorry, but look at how many times players come out and refute storylines. For example, Jeremy Lin once said on a podcast (maybe Zach Lowe? I don't remember. Sorry, but no source on me lol) that Stephen A. was reporting how Lin signed with Brooklyn in 2016. And Lin said he was watching that and thought to himself ""I never even saw this offer."" So stuff like all the media gossip? It's all with a grain of salt for me. 

And also when it comes to ""why does watching the team matter?"" Well, the coverage of that team was insane thanks to Linsanity. MSG Pregame shows were like 2 hours long covering everything that the team was doing. TMZ followed the Knicks around a lot during their team dinners. Seemed like they all were young and having a good time. Was Melo out here plotting that whole time like boy if this dude Lin doesn't get me the ball lmao. And now that Carmelo said on First Take that he admittedly was immature when he was younger, it just drives the debate even more. 

So that's really it. Fwiw, it's always Melo stan v. Lin stan. I got love for both of them. I wish Lin never tore his meniscus. I also wish Melo's tenure worked out better here in NY. But the situation happened and it's not 2012 anymore.",nba

"Smoothies are blended fruit. Some options have added juice or milk, which adds sugar as well, but it's not like they're just adding sugar to the smoothie to make it taste better. 

If there is ice cream, frozen yogurt, or lemonade in your smoothie, you can pick a different, healthier option.

The specific smoothie you listed is made with lemonade (mostly sugar), lime sherbet (mostly sugar), and frozen yogurt (mostly sugar). Considering the ingredients, its one of the least smoothie-like and most unhealthy options on the menu. It's basically a fruity milkshake.

Obviously it's not something you should do every day, but there is nothing unhealthy about drinking a smoothie if you are aware of these things, make the smart choice, and avoid unnecessary sugar in your other meals. If you made a smoothie at home with fresh fruit and milk, it would have a very similar nutritional profile to a lot of the options.

Draymond Green was not an All-Star caliber player last season and will have to be much more impactful in the regular season.

* Oladipo will likely miss a large chunk of the beginning of the season. Brogdon also has health concerns dating back to college and he has missed 52 regular season games over the last two seasons.
* Sabonis will be the starting 4, but he is not fit to guard most 4s. The defensive drop-off from Young to Sabonis is severe.
* They have no small forwards and will really struggle to guard the league's best forwards. Lamb and Justin Holiday are undersized (primarily SGs), Warren is not a good defender and more of a PF anyway, and McDermott is a poor defender as well.",nba

AD's ""not worthy"" of being part of what the Pelicans are building

&gt;if sex appeal is your thing and you need a big market, OK. See you later.

Basically accusing AD of being shallow and only being interested in appearances/ glory. ""See you later"" is about as passive-aggressive as you can get as well.

&gt;If doing something meaningful for people who care about supporting their teams every day is important, this is something you're going to want to be a part of.""

Again, throwing AD's motivations into question, implying that he doesn't value support his team every day, that he doesn't appreciate doing 'meaningful' things.

Obviously you don't blame Griffin for saying what he did, given AD's actions over the past year, but there's definite tension/ beef there IMO",nba

"Two things;

1) How is winning a chip and potentially ending the modern dynasty only enough to make the Raps semi-relevant? Last I checked, any team that regularly makes the playoffs and goes on good runs is relevant; unless, of course, that bar got changed while I wasn't looking.

2) I didn't say Steph made the Dubs relevant, I said it wasn't *just* Steph. The rest of the team is important too; you don't win in 2015 without guys like Draymond, Bogut, or Livingston. It's a team sport, and while you need superstars like Steph and Kawhi to win titles, those superstars cannot ever carry a team to a championship on their own.",nba

"Couple things, 1: another team can only get 3 years guaranteed from another team, but 5 from the Raps.  Meaning if he signs an offer sheet, the Raps get a shorter contract than they might want.

https://ca.nba.com/news/why-hasnt-pascal-siakam-signed-an-extension-with-the-toronto-raptors-yet/12kdi9wau08zu1w7xqb37s96eu

&gt;The Jazz found themselves in a similar situation with Hayward as the Raptors do with Siakam, and they chose to let Hayward play out his contract and test free agency instead of signing him to a five-year extension. That decision led him to an offer sheet with the Charlotte Hornets in the summer of 2014, which the Jazz matched, but it paved the way for Hayward to test free agency again - this time as an unrestricted free agent - three years later.

&gt;As a result, Hayward left the Jazz for the Boston Celtics just when the franchise appeared to be turning a corner.

&gt;The Jazz rebounded in a way nobody could have foreseen - they were fortunate to draft Donovan Mitchell with the 13th pick in the same summer Hayward left - but it's impossible to predict the Raptors having the same fortune if Siakam were to follow in Hayward's footsteps. In which case, the Raptors run the risk of seeing Siakam walk as he's entering the prime of his career by not getting a deal done now.

#2, if they wait, and Pascal makes an all-NBA team, suddenly, Siakam becomes more expensive.

&gt; ""[Siakam is] eligible for a baseline 25 percent of the 2020-21 salary cap in Year 1 salary, which projects to pay him $168.2 million over five years.""

&gt; ""If he makes an All-NBA team this year, wins MVP or Defensive Player of the Year, then he's eligible for up to 30 percent of the cap, which would pay him $201.8 million on a five-year deal. He can negotiate that raise up to 30 percent in the extension, as Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray have already done with their respective teams this offseason.""

tl;dr

The Raps can max Siakam for $168.2 / 5 Years if they sign him before the season.

If Siakam signs an offer sheet next year, it will be a 3 year + player option, meaning the Raps lose 2 contract years.

If Siakam makes an all-NBA team, the max will cost the Raps $201.8 / 5 Years.",nba

To be fair, that team overachieved to the tune of a 66-16 record, and a 39-2 record at home. None of that really matters though when we couldn't get out of the East Finals. If we make that deal, we could have rolled out Mo Williams-Delonte West-LeBron-Amare- Big Z. I think it would have hurt our depth a little, but we could have maybe staggered LeBron and Amare a bit to have bench lineups around Amare during LeBron's rest times. 

Overall it just goes back to the old Bill Simmons adage of ""You always turn four quarters into a dollar if you can"" Amare was a legit star at this point, and trading for him could have been the difference in not only the 2009 East Finals, but the 2009 NBA Finals, and LeBron's free agency.",nba

"I’m pretty sure that the media and the NBA are doing whatever they can to promote him in order to strengthen and open up new markets of revenue. Maybe it’s just the salty rockets fan in me, but I really believe that whether or not Giannis actually had a better season than Harden he was going to win anyways. With how good the West is now and with LeBron leaving the East, the NBA needed to find another “King of the East” to secure profitability in the markets in that conference. Not only that, he’s European and openly fond of his African heritage. He can single handedly open and secure more markets in two different continents. Guys like Harden, LeBron, and Curry already have secure fanbases and markets, so the NBA needs to look towards their TAM (total available markets) if it wants to grow. Giannis is a big part of this growth. At the end of the day, the NBA is a business. The media is a business. They’re both gonna do what they can to increase the profitability of they’re respective businesses and Giannis at this point in time does just that.",nba

And when XP landed in 2002 it turned out to be a huge resource sink to keep it secure as it got attacked constantly. He navigated all that and got the company out of that hole relatively unscathed. 

Sure he had huge major failures like mobile and web strategies, but he also had huge huge successes with Azure, Office365, Xbox, etc. I think the company easily could have fallen into obscurity with all those existential threats, but it didn't. 

A lot of the things that Nadella gets to realize as successes were initiatives started under Ballmer, such as cross-platform office, and a huge re-org right before he left.

For the record, I think Ballmer stepping down was absolutely the right move and Nadella is doing an excellent job having Microsoft do exciting things again.",nba

"&gt; Like those numbers aren't really better than Giannis's regular season numbers are they?

1. Playoffs are weighted more heavily because you’re constantly playing the best teams. You don’t get to put up an easy 39 points on the suns on 70% shooting. Kawhi did this against the fucking 76ers, a team with the best defensive lineup in the league by a mile (their starting lineups DRTG in the playoffs was 90. NINETY.)

Interesting how Giannis killed it in the RS and then his efficiency dropped in the playoffs. Because he was constantly facing elite teams. 

&gt; Everyone in that top tier has bonkers stats. Kawhi's don't really stand out compared to other great playoff runs.

Look up how many guys have ever put up the stats Kawhi did during this playoff run. Just the points and efficiency, we’ll ignore his D and clutch shooting. 

Hint: it’s only ever been done 8 times. If you count only those who even made it out of the 1st round, it’s 4 times. Once by KD, once by Kareem, twice by LeBron. Kawhi did this on a bum leg and won the chip.

Nobody said anything and neither did Tiger, and the other guys sort of looked at one another.

Finally one of the SEALs said, ""Separate checks, please.""

The waitress walked away.

Curry is probably the best shooter of all time but that doesnt make him a better scorer. Offenses are way more efficient nowadays with great spacing. If kobe had the gravity of a klay thompson or kevin durant he would be unstoppable. Kobe was constantly doubled with nowhere near the spacing curry gets now.

Odom was a better player than SJax and Bowen, tbh.  

FWIW I do think Duncan's 03 teammates were better than Kobe's 06 guys, but at the same time given how good Duncan was that season I also think he gets them into the playoffs if you swap the two.  Not a chip, necessarily, but playoffs sure.

25.6 PER, .196 WS/48, 60.4 WS, 6.2 BPM, 30.6 VORP

MVP, 2x DPOY, 5x All-Star, 2x All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team, All-NBA Third Team, 2x All-NBA First Team Defense, All-NBA Second Team Defense

Duncan 02-06:

22.1 ppg, 12.1 rpg, 3.4 apg, 3.3 stl/blk on 550 TS%

26.2 PER, .238 WS/48, 69.4 WS, 6.7 BPM, 30.9 VORP

2 titles, 2 FMVP (he already has one of each in 99), 49 playoff wins

2 MVP, 5x All-Star, 4x All-NBA First Team, All-NBA Second Team, 3x All-NBA First Team Defense, 2x All-NBA Second Team Defense

so basically a wash with the slight edge on Tim Duncan

That's still technically true with the current rules where you can miss the first and still make the next two. With the new rules if you miss the first you get zero points.

You’re also ignoring context. Most of Kareem’s prime was during the worst decade in modern NBA history and he was the best player on his six title winning teams like three times maximum. Michael always had better teams/weaker competition in the Finals, as well better coaching than LeBron has ever had.

"Well it’s like this. You are right in the sense that a humans potential ceiling (in all facets) is determined at birth. But how do you determine determination it self. Is it possible that major advancements in science never happened because some genius fried his brain on some addiction somewhere? Is it possible that some motivated and determined reasonably intelligent person out there dedicated their entire life in quest of some medical discovery (passion pursuit) and succeeded? 

In the examples you gave I can say that I agree and disagree. I do find high intelligence and natural rhythm more impressive but I don’t always view the individuals that possess those traits as impressive. If they use those natural talents and expand on them and the result is amazing then yes I can be impressed by both their “gift” and effort, but if they coast by then what am I impressed by? Natural selection at work?

I suppose in the end, if I assessed accomplishments and the individuals behind them with the same approach that you use, there would be no reason for me not to support something like eugenics. Also if all it takes is being “less than ideal” for you to cease pursuit of self betterment, then you are essentially against self improvement of any form. I don’t know what “ideal” is in your opinion, but to me no one is ideal. And we are not discussing how ideal they are to me, it is whether they feel ideal about themselves. So even someone like the girl from Wolf of Wall Street (the blonde wife) is not ideal because even though I see zero flaws on her, (physically I mean) I am sure that she probably hates something about herself like a triangular toenail or some shit.  No one is ideal, using it as an excuse against self improvement is like a never ending cycle of complacency.",nba

99-05 he had a damn good argument.  It was him and Shaq at 1a and 1b pretty much.  Three chips, three finals MVPs, and didn't really have a great supporting cast for a fair chunk of that time, as Robinson was past his prime and Parker / Ginobili joined midway.  

&gt; Kobe was considered the best player in the world throughout both of their careers 

LOL Kobe wasn't even considered the best player on his team til Shaq left.  *You* might think he was considered the best player in the world 'throughout both of their careers' but most people did not.  There were maybe a couple years where he was the consensus best, but he sure as hell wasn't considered the best when he was missing the payoffs and getting knocked out in the first round.  

If we're talking who were considered best, it'd probably be something like 98-2006: Shaq or Duncan, 2007-08: Kobe, 2009-?: Lebron.  That's a rough draft, and the years are probably debatable, but point is Kobe realistically had a short period where he was considered the best player in the world.",nba

"Yeah the one I’m talking about is the one where Embiid put up 40/15 and won the game. That’s the purpose of that whole basketball thing. We lost Redick but picked up Horford who can hit and provides excellent defense. We also picked up Jrich who can hit and provides excellent defense. JJ is a big loss but he was a major defensive hole. Also you’re very much exaggerating Giannis’ “domination” of Embiid and Horford. You’re acting as though all of his points came while they were his primary defenders, which is simply false. Regardless, Giannis can score as much as he wants, and dominate everybody, you lost that game. Our team has gotten better, yours hasn’t. Giannis dominating won’t singlehandedly win a series, in fact he showed last year that he can be gameplanned for when the Raptors beat you in 4 straight after we took them to 7.

Of course, I’m also not making up takes out of thin air about how good our defence on Embiid is like people are about Embiid/Horford on Giannis. Unfortunately it takes more than one player to win games, which is why Giannis put up 52/16/7 and still lost to Embiid’s 40/15, and you just lost your best shooter and second best performer against us.

I’m not arguing, in this instance, that we’ll win the series off the back of Giannis’ domination. I do think we’ll win the series but I laid out my reasoning elsewhere. I’m arguing that the idea that Philly is somehow a great defensive matchup for Giannis when nobody on that team has ever stopped him in the regular season or playoffs is nonsense.

And “showing he can be gameplanned for” means next to nothing when a different team (featuring Horford on Giannis, no less) used that same game plan the series prior and got wrecked.

"The reason Kobe is often seen as inefficient of offense is because he shot from anywhere (which sets off the whole rim and three crowd), the fact that his injuries late in his career magnified his shot selection issues, and his perceived tunnel vision on offense with regards to passing to his teammates.

On the other hand, Timmy's offense was effective like Kobe's (if a bit hampered by inconsistent FTs), it's just that he never developed a reputation for hogging the ball because he wasn't perceived as taking touches away from a Shaq-level player. Both are hurt anyway by spending many seasons of their careers in the pre-shot efficiency area, and neither is known for being a sharpshooter from beyond the arc.",nba

I feel like the raptors are similar to the Pistons. Many teams made some big moves or lost some players too. The raps probably have the least to adjust.

"If you don’t understand why this team is great defensively there’s no point in arguing with you. On top of that, if you think that Giannis’ performance against great defenders while they were on different teams means that together they will be helpless you need to seriously reevaluate. You’re talking about his performance as though he is constantly 1V1 vs these players. You’re also acting as though his performance against them while they were on different teams will be the same now that they’re together, and now that the Sixers defense as a whole has gotten substantially bette. Team defense is a thing, ours got better, we got better length, better interior defense, stronger etc.. everything we got better at is everything that we need for a player like Giannis.

"Being great defensively isn’t the same thing as being a great matchup against Giannis specifically. He was constantly 1v1 against Embiid, you yourself said as much, that was supposed to be the gameplan yeah? It’s not like the Celtics had Horford surrounded by poor defenders, they’re a very good defensive outfit too and Giannis still torched their wall in the playoffs. I fully understand basketball isn’t a 1v1 game, but I also understand that none of the players on your team have had any level of success as a primary matchup against Giannis and your team as a whole hasn’t been able to effectively contain our offence at any point.

Your logic is essentially “we have a bunch of good defenders, therefore this is a favourable matchup”, but you should know that’s not how it works. Last year’s playoffs were a great example in fact. Our guard rotation was much better defensively than yours, mostly because we didn’t have a Redick-level defensive disaster, but the Raptors’ guards couldn’t do anything against you guys while they torched us all series. As bad as Bledsoe choked offensively, he was still playing solid D. Didn’t matter though, because our matchups and defensive schemes simply weren’t as effective as yours. The same applies here, there’s nothing that should reasonably lead somebody to believe this is a favourable defensive matchup for Philly because both the individual players and the team/coaching as a whole has never been effective.",nba

"Individual performance is a poor metric when everything about that individuals circumstances has changed. Additionally Horford will now be in at PF rather than Tobi which is a massive upgrade defensively. Both he and Embiid are excellent defenders with Embiid being at a DPOY level with good mobility and great interior protection. Giannis hasn’t had to go against the two of them on the same team, and he hasn’t seen something similar with any kind of consistency. Your issue is that you’re looking at individuals out of context and then choosing to ignore the makeup of our team and the situations of these players changing. You can’t talk defense without noting that our team has gotten SUBSTANTIALLY better defensively, yet you’ve exclusively talked about losing JJ in our offense. Horford and Jrich make up for the JJ loss offensively, they just provide scoring in different ways. Shockingly, now that our team has different players, we will play differently. You can’t just ignore context and talk about individual matchups as though it all exists in a vacuum. Either way I’m done with you, your take is bad.",nba

The same way Ibaka always playing with a boner to give him a foot of extra space.,nba
"$60m means CP3 is sacrificing $60m of pay and the Thunder are paying $60m for him to go away.

ffs that's about half of a year's entire salary cap.",nba
kobe + dfish,nba
"&gt;If he wants his 38 mil then fine, Oklahoma City will pay him but don’t complain about wasting away the twilight years of your career on a rebuilding team.

Is he even complaining?",nba
so one negates the other?,nba
everyday we stray further from god's light,nba
Fuck he dceu'd  us!,nba
"It's the exact same form as videos that surfaced late last off-season, truthfully.",nba
Well Paul’s contract is an OKC problem lol they traded for it at the end of the day,nba
"he's chasing something he can't catch

he had no chance from rip because of nostalgic reasons

also the fact that he just isn't as good

any argument you could make is thrown out the window after his 2011 finals performance",nba
Or Kobe and Lamar,nba
Is this a joke? How can you seriously be this biased. Regardless of whether or not you agree with me how can you think that Ben Simmons says nothing?,nba
"I'm still high on him. He's easily better than CJ at least, even considering that series",nba
The leg shimmy before the punch,nba
All I know is what J. Cole said about him. Did he have an injury or something then need to rehab his shot??,nba
I think 35 year old Bron should 100% defer to AD in the regular season. Save whatever he can for the playoffs.,nba
Bargnani wasn't good but he was at least a serviceable starter for a decade.,nba
"I still have love for my man Kelle, but these are empty words. I heard the same shit last year and got myself hyped for nothing. I really hope you'll live up to your potential, but I need to see you play first.",nba
Calling Josh Richardson an elite defender puts you on my top 3 hot takes for this season,nba
Harden and Capela?,nba
Gsw has heen linked to him but ive seen 0 warrior fans talking about it,nba
Damn man this is great. What would the All Dirk Nowitzki team be?,nba
"Lol. If this franchise gets turned around, it will have a hell of a lot more to do with LeBron, AD, and Vogel than with anyone else.",nba
kobe won 5 with fish. 2 with odom,nba
"Yeah, he won a FMVP",nba
"“Raptors adjusted”

You mean FVV shot 90% from 3 the last 4 games lmao",nba
They need to get their D-line healthy and tgeir receivers need to stop dropping well-thrown balls.,nba
also keep in mind that this would hit the Thunder in the luxury tax so even $60m would cost them like $100m+ actually.,nba
Step away the internet,nba
"I understand why people value his longevity, but Magic, Steph, Nash, AI, Russ, Oscar, Harden, and Cousy all won MVPs. They were voted the best player in the league and Stockton was voted one of the 2 best guards twice (when MJ retired). 

Unless you want somebody for 20 years, there’s like 10 point guards minimum I’m taking before Stockton",nba
Superstar and Role Player? Caruso and Lebron,nba
The way he framed it as the solution to his ridiculous hypothetical... fucking beautiful,nba
I’m trying to lower my IQE to your level but ur right I cant,nba
say Andre Igoudala is an MVP.,nba
"Hows that comparison fair?

Rapts were still fire without Kawhi last year during reg season, and now they have a Marc Gasol with an expanded role, fresh off shipping the world cup.",nba
So I take it you’ve never watched him play before...,nba
"He discovered 3 future MVPs outside of the top 5 of the draft (Nash, Curry, Dirk) and once drafted 6 straight All Stars (1988-1993).",nba

Okay so whatever they pay to part ways with him will count against that years cap space. THIS is the information I needed to understand what makes this so difficult,nba

JJ is a roleplayer?,nba
Andre Iguodala is a finals MVP,nba
Jeanie is quietly one of the worst big market owners in the league.,nba
"Lmao he had 1 bad series, jordan never won a playoff without pippen. Literally every super star has atleast 1 mess up. Jordan is the better scorer and 2 way player but imo prime bron is probably the best basketball player at everything. Dude can defend like a DPOY, pass like a pg, if he gets hot hit 3's all game etc. Like I said Jordan is still the GOAT but bron is the only one to challenge him and isnt even done yet. The biggest thing besides the rings MJ has going for him is the whole making the NBA bigger which I will always be grateful for otherwise I wouldnt be in the sport.",nba
YES. it sends ya into the fucking luxury tax dude.,nba
Honestly I could do that if nobody was guarding me,nba
Now this is big brain time.,nba
"Thank you, Hakeem and David Robinson are actually extremely similar yet rankings have the Admiral WAY below Hakeem.",nba
I'm international so I don't really know if this is typical off-season mess or nephew of the nephew hour.,nba
"I agree, I don’t see why this sub are so high on them, they underachieved in the playoffs.",nba
I know it's the off season but this post is fucking stupid. ANYONE could grow out their beard to achieve this advantage. Why single out James?,nba
One of the best,nba
No publicly but it’s generally known that he isn’t happy about not being on a contender. Wasn’t intending to imply that he is vocally complaining,nba
that's a coward's reason,nba
Superstar and Role Player not two goats,nba
Because he’s doesn’t??? The only thing I can really think of were his RotY comments which weren’t even bad. He just said he thought he was favorite. And he was. He won by a landslide. And Mitchell started that whole back and forth anyway,nba
"The Eastern Conference Finals winner is going to be determined by who has developed their jumper more, Simmons or Giannis.",nba
"They’re going to be fun offensively, but Dray is gonna be carrying huge weight on defense.",nba
They’re up there.,nba
"No, but it is an example of his tendency to not be aggressive enough.",nba
"I agree he can play in this league, but his hype was insane and it’s legit warranted, he has out of this world athleticism but zero motor and IQ....if you gave the average player his body you’d have a freaking perennial all star",nba
I initially wasn’t sold on this idea until I saw the example images,nba
"His D helped make Miami elite, the ability to switch up top. Elite team defender, in my opinion. But sure, no rewards for it.

At their peak, Miami was fast and athletic. Obviously as Wade’s injuries mounted, it limited them... but they were definitely a super team. In comparison to all superteams, obviously you can argue many surpassed. But Bosh was solid.",nba
True either one is really good,nba
I can hear the other countries announcers in this GIF...,nba
What do you think he is?,nba
I know he exceeded big Ben but did he exceed Garnett that much?.. honest question,nba
"Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles",nba
wasn't playoffs,nba
you already conceded that MJ is better lol no need to go off on a tangent,nba
Only 4 more days of offseason left...,nba
"By moving his head constantly in both vertical and horizontal planes, he’d be able to deny a significant 3-dimensional amount of space in front of him. 

If he is allowed to take charges to his beard, this also becomes a significant defensive tool as well, making him a true threat on both ends of the court. 

Tl;dr This is his key to taking back the MVP award.",nba
"That's not how hair grows though, it doesn't have an infinite amount of time in the growth stage.",nba
good arguements,nba
"Wade?  Dude was washed at that point, but still.  

Wade &amp; Bron apparently almost signed during The Decision year too, and would've if Bosh hadn't said he wanted in.  Wade / Bron / pre-MVP Rose / Deng / Noah would've been nuts.",nba
like Kawhi is MVP *caliber* and he has an FMVP but if we start calling FMVP as just MVP then we'll run into weird shit like calling *Andre Igoudala* an MVP. which is why ppl don't do it.,nba
"Well bud, you got it right Team USA sucked ass. I dun goofed lol",nba
Me too...,nba
Joe Ingles is a goat not a role player,nba
Ah you guys are in for a ride.,nba
Well he did draw a foul with a beard on Derozen and it was a massive turning point.,nba
Atlanta has a much better culture than those three do when it comes to appealing to nba players,nba
"Isn't Randle like 92? 

like bruuhhhh",nba
"Just stating my opinon bro, if you feel different is all good everyone has their own opinon. Like I said bron is the only person to challenge him and he aint done yet. Have a good night bro :).",nba
The Barbary network usually airs them,nba
"His 30 for 30 could be cool. ""What if I told you...there was an electrifying prospect who went #1 in the draft, and then *forgot* how to play basketball?""",nba
So were the 14-15 Hawks were a super team?,nba
Hawks were willing to buyout Melo because they had a fuckload of empty cap space.,nba
"Are you kidding, this is the best part.",nba
Visit r/SquaredCircle sometimes. I haven't kept up with wrestling in years but it's cool to check up sometimes.,nba
I didn't,nba
Anthony Bennet would beg to differ lol,nba
"I just dont see it.

The other one’s a giant shooting guard, the other one’s a mobile shooting big.

Just because they both are almost unguardable with their jumpers doesnt mean they’re similar at all.",nba
IMO Lamar Odom is too good and has too well-rounded of a skill set to be considered a role player. He fits in the gap between All-Star and role player.,nba
"he is definitely as good, if not better, as an individual player. It's just ignorant to say he isn't. 

but you're right, he's chasing something he can't catch

nobody will beat jordans perfect legacy",nba
"Mavs, Celtics, and Raptors are a real possibility. I don’t see him or any other superstar going to GS after the whole KD fiasco.",nba
My guy,nba
It looks like LeBron is getting the soul sucked out of him lmao,nba
When did he start?,nba
So? Kobe + Lamar was still a far better duo,nba
Yes I know they're only on after thursday night tnt games. I've literally never seen inside the NBA on the TV schedule here.,nba
"If those spikes got you in the eye, it would have been bad",nba
Which is why we have a thing called context,nba
TIL Giannis is better than KD,nba
Tim Duncan as well,nba
"The 1st Trio is probably the best, even if it marginalises Hakeem something chronic.

I think I like the 3rd trio best even if it has the worst best player.",nba
"BY the logic that his beard would be part of his body, would he not risk fouling himself out very quickly every game?",nba
I think personally that he’s 12 or so but either way top ten is still top fifteen haha,nba
It doesn’t.,nba
"imo while a shot would help him when he's the ballhandler, he also sometimes does badly against an organized playoff defense because he's inexperienced. I don't think that's the biggest issue, more that offball he can be ignored unless he's in the dunker's position or the defense gives up a cut.",nba
I thought he was from the Seattle area.. TIL,nba
"Yay, I guess?",nba
"this. props for actually saying something bold. hate it when ""bold predictions"" are just ""not universally agreed upon.""",nba
this is low tier trolling/bait,nba
could he grow his beard long enough to fashion it into a pogo stick and just launch himself from 3/4 court?  How the fuck you gonna defend that shit?,nba
la petite mort,nba
KD's got bars and that smooth baritone voice.,nba
Half goat half snek,nba
