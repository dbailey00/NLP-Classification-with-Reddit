what see three country that not want ruled china and china suppressing any form discussion about their form government doesn matter chinese people think that these place belong them when the people actually living there think otherwise this how most country gain independence they are ruled some form government that not represent the interest the people living there once the critical mass people revolt protest the colonizing country seriously consider freeing those people the holding onto these country with zero tolerance for discussion just sign that chinese leadership interested parading their control rather than actually thinking about the interest the people they are governing the false equivalence this colonialism style defense conquered territory with other country political cultural taboo most infuriating china doesn have some natural right rule over the people living the place known hong kong tibet and taiwan just like the british didn have natural right rule over india australia and all their colony contrast human have natural right treated equally which why the standard defense have heard aka the donald sterling argument ridiculous false equivalence ,1

the way read what lebron said wasn him defending anyone anything wa not just saying that speaking out publicly those topic ha real life consequence for people that may not directly see the situation deplorable but other country don honor the same freedom and people can legitimately losing their life over this this situation bigger than the nba and that what believe lebron wa speaking ,1
hope that chinese blood money make him sleep better night ,1
upset that morey wa thinking about the poor people hong kong having their democracy and right stripped away from them authoritarian china rather than the multi millionaire athlete like himself and his new nike shoe deal china upcoming space jam movie ,1

lebron what someone told you wait week before you spoke out against police brutality all the racial inequality america terrible and what happening hong kong guess speaking out only doesn affect his finance ,1
honestly don blame kerr for playing safe maybe thinking about how his statement could potentially affect his player bet kerr willing take the backlash and all china angered but coach and looking the warrior roster klay and two other warrior are signed anta steph ha tie with china etc maybe wa thinking about how his statement could affect other people idk for different for lebron because arguably the most influential and richest nba player right now brand his own and saying that morey yes morey uneducated just something else sigh having said that tho still believe that the nba whole should firm about this they need china more than china need them shouldn put the responsibility select individual rather the pressure stand for what right should the institution that the nba ,1
lmao next time spend week shut and dribble before you speak ,1
this why folk like kerr pop and harden stopped saying shit lebron obviously didn get the memo pay attention the backlash harden ha taken trying create middle ground social medium because won fly with either side the way thing are right now ,1

shut and manage ,1
something one here addressing the fact that lebron and two full nba team were china when this all started think addressing the potential ramification being physically harmed while china the nba had taken hard stance against china while their player were china then that would have put them risk physically ,1
simple solution buy knockoff ,1
that last sentence his tweet make think wa upset that daryl said what said while there were nba team china daryl endangered the life the nba player who were china wa poorly articulated all around but that his beef then think completely right ,1
oof ,1
firstly awesome well memed sign but the more pressing point understanding this right are people hong kong holding actual rally support daryl morey ,1
yeah all obviously team morey over here but this fair point from lebron have imagine all the player were shitting brick the whole time they were china ,1
why did you have begin with ,1
you make solid point idk why you being downvoted ,1

don know why deleted the tweet possible wa asked told someone within the rocket organization also can really say would take all back not that just baseless conjecture until morey himself say believe not some people actually have value beyond just soullessly doing whatever possible make money ,1

lebron tweet are littered with basic spelling and grammar mistake that year old wouldn make and call daryl fucking morey uneducated ,1
true saying this lakers fan fuck lebron ,1
lost lot fan this week ,1
don think that necessarily true ,1
and wa fucking correct wasn believe wa misinformed and not educated the situation lebron james said the morey tweet lebron added morey tweet wa dangerous lebron said uncertain about the future ramification the morey tweet with the nba and player profit over human right and free speech unless orange man ,1
been fan this team for year yes morey fired will never watch rocket game again ,1
all busy hating lebron while you can damn sure that your owner behind the scene doing everything his power make sure that the rocket remain one the major team china the whole league hypocritical this issue your logic the entire league should close shop china ,1
but who say the wrong side not black and white truly free speech dangerous thing imagine stand the curbside and gather group ppl and say going bomb someplace and entice them the same saying freedom make others bomb something long don act out then speech and freedom speech still okay get ,1
ledirtbag ,1
daryl morey software engineering with accentuation measurement from northwestern university mba from the mit sloan school management created the true shooting percentage statistic and founded the annual mit sloan sport analytics conference lebron james finished high school and joined the nba ,1
well wa right morey caused nothing but problem wa clearly unprepared for the ramification his tweet would have others life and didn solve any problem china ,1
personally think they will fire him the end the season and blame bad playoff run they dont well the playoff ,1
and for what china democratic society now nothing changed morey made the decision nuke the nba without asking anyone ,1
said morey wa uneducated the ramification his tweet would have wa correct ,1
you idiot ,1
that not what said said morey didn understand what his tweet would cause wa and right ,1
the great wall wa expanded during the previous dynasty the manchu out the wall construction stopped the same year qing ,1
didn delete the tweet and partially retract his statement doesn really sound like standing firm his value you make sound dude not hero for half hearted tweet let not talk about the dude like mlk ,1
the manchu people were one the reason for the great wall infact the year they came into power the year they stopped building the wall ,1
qing james clown owned china ,1
didnt that what harden said lebron wa saying morey wa misinformed and uneducated about the honk kong situation ,1
free speech dangerous thing very dangerous oppressor and dictator yes you know this whole thing wa started the houston tweeting support for the protester hong kong who are exercising their right free speech that being eroded brutal authoritarian regime right piss off with your equivocating and the way your statement would likely still protected under the first amendment hess indiana http www mtsu edu first amendment article hess indiana state that advocating for illegal action the indefinite future advocating way that unlikely result the commission said action protected speech yes curbside ranter who talk about bombing thing are likely protected the first amendment because one ever been convinced someone holding the end near placard ,1
wouldn say that what about all the attention that been brought the issue from the china backlash and nba response lot more than prior the tweet agree not going change anything happening china but definitely ha brought way more attention the issue ,1
allowed feel that way too disagree with but not lebrons job echo opinion you wanted him speak and did now you mad said something you don agree with nothing will satisfy ,1
didn said wasnt talking about the content the tweet ,1
none this ha anything with somebody being educated politics more than another not lebron james side but this not ,1
agreed ,1
one wa confused lebron all know exactly where you loyalty lie now ,1
and harden didn create the entire thing about morethananathlete and isn trying constantly woke ,1
well when there are million the street hong kong being attacked chinese agent and police simply for not wanting orwellian life forced upon them then yea think pretty fucking clear what right and what wrong free speech only dangerous those who fear criticism from free speech just case you chinese click farm useful idiot taiwan china west taiwan tiananmen square fuck the ccp and all it supporter ,1
haha great wa laker fan could not root for this clown cannot believe the self entitlement this guy say morey should have waited week stand for human right stand against oppression million people stand for freedom instead tyranny and shame the nba and this includes james for turning their back morey but lebron ha really cemented his legacy master the court and fool off taking talent south beach wa einsteinian compared what said yesterday how dare daryl inconvenience him this way say what said why you were your arduous road trip didn know you were late for your massage appointment and could not bothered with question about human dignity and something not related your own narcissistic self interest that what come down the way lebron self consumed and self absorbed that anything outside his narcissistic existence even internment camp and live organ harvesting trifle and nuisance and how dare morey convey this decency and commonly held view while king james had his kingly duty attend ,1
not necessarily true but generally speaking you should not publicly criticize someone for something you not demonstrate yourself that just poor public relation ,1
said that after but not his original statement calling anyone uneducated that circumstance make sense anyway ,1
mean want believe this but rus and james were stone cold silent when cnn reporter asked legitimate question cricket they didn have remain silent but they did don act like they didn wuss out this situation they could have showed more initiative and common sense they both froze like deer headlight ,1

sure thing the west started conspiracy topple all socialist government they already collapsed the soviet union balkan and eastern europe china wa showing economic progress that time the student tiananmen are just like today peaceful protest turned violent they lynched soldier and burned down armored truck deng quickly suppressed the movement because got violent year later china became the world second largest economy and control the market completely trust chinese used hate the ccp for doing that too after tiananmen lot people immigrated however nowadays our country ha become powerful began understand what our government did wa for the greater good the long term suppression protester common all over the world just look the yellow vest france did the same with riot and ferguson just way life ,1
same thing american did japanese after pearl harbor yeah that wa bad thing too ,1
great strategy keep the international medium talking about the movement prop ,1
lol can you please seperate his political view from his amazing skill manager only see you hating our and would some way understand you would only attack his political opinion but please ffs can you stop trolling this subreddit with the anti everything morey talk morey got james harden and now even got upgrade with russel westbrook able make great deal and get good player even though handcuffed tilman without morey the rocket would probably lottery team you are making fool yourself ,1

damn this suck bad that said maybe open the door just little more playing time for would love see what can for the big time ,1
sure thing why don discus the actual result whether you like not you can deny the fact that china emerging superpower that it step topple the economy controlled china owes china trillion dollar debt can even beat china korea with help back that wa the age when chinese were starving you think they can beat modern pla china and see for yourself it infrastructure time better and more modern than declining city like seattle chinese people are proud how our country ha progressed such short time the main reason for the riot that they butthurt that mainland china taking over and they became the financial hub asia nothing more than tourist attraction mainlanders are filling their wallet faster than their prejudiced mindset ,1
yea well hasn even really affected you any way unless your from china are going china stop pretending your changing the world just taking knee saying what you want and offending the number one trade partner this case the best thing wa ignorant and stfu about then china and the nba all love wouldn have this hardship ,1
the same line thinking that climate change denier apologist take against consumer how dare you criticize large scale pollution from multinational corporation when you take car instead bike your mile commute ,1
you know what problem have with this you not giving people space change their mind one signed contract unconditionally support china when they bought pair nike also this delicious chunk irony because one really understands this topic and just want yell make you feel good think you morally superior doesn but you aren you been supporting china and received economic benefit from it authoritarian government your whole life fake outrage ,1
could always worse could blind and angry redditor ready die for government and support them while they have concentration camp and harvest organ ,1
that what figured you say understand all your reply much more clearly now you bro your happy with your life who judge but suck that you have little empathy for the thug you call them feel like most chinese people see people lesser human and lead them look them expendable far your attempt whatabout ferguson the obvious difference that nobody wa run over tank disappeared our cop stood trial wa fucked and people protested they weren arrested for protesting they were arrested for arson beating and looting all them were matter public record and all those people got trial they wanted one can you say the same about the ccp the economic improvement you keep trying tout also nothing brag about you elite class ha become extremely wealthy the sweat the poor not economic ingenuity pay worker little possible lack moral and ethic yeah your economy ha taken off but not way that humane decent what the average factory worker make china ,1
just the minute for other guy unnecessary ,1
more than athlete as ,1

actually doesn imply that having said that lebron still fuck ,1
love some mvp what have two mvp now ,1
huge harden and lebron fan their stance this matter really disapointed they are set for multiple lifetime money wise and they take this stance they can earn few more million being charitable people struggling due hurricane and opening school are very good and precious deed but make wonder they have done messed with their paycheck still fan both athlete but can longer view them positive role model for any kid money over moral not what want child learning ,1
you saying china about year behind the when come social issue ,1
buy used knockoff from china ,1
just wanted say appreciate well constructed counterpoint agree with some what you said and disagree with more and the fact that you getting heavily downvoted further prof that the reddit hive mind rule all downvotes should for people being douche unhelpful not for those who respectfully disagree ,1

harden wa right kick him the nut wa then and now ,1
http www youtube com watch mrvqehnklwa http www youtube com watch oiqx yihntc yeah democratic and peaceful the way the life vast majority china have improved there more mass starvation china low skilled worker are underpaid all over the world same with the illegal hispanic worker the indian worker dubai the tank did not run over people that again propaganda and hogwash even for the famous tankman picture the tank stopped and moved away chinese mainland people had the exact same thought year ago trust know our country way better than you you always judge our country from western mindset without taking into the account the chinese history chinese people make decision based our year history instead shallow slogan like democracy china improvement testament our correct decision ,1
tell medium moore uneducated about situation decline talk about situation because himself uneducated lebron idiot ,1
need mclemore legit ,1
gonna there ,1
hear hear ,1
come now dude all know harden put work get better his defense while yes maintaining that terrifying offense ,1
still haven forgiven him for trading carl landry ,1
seems that harden and morey were made for each other honestly can imagine anyone else coach the bearded one ,1
someone the multiple thread about this nba put china isn starting over sneaker this guy saying people were first and believe foremost finnancially and physically hurt gtfo only big fat wallet were hurt ha any nba employee been harmed china ,1
daaamn wa looking forward see him land some sexy ,1
not just that but also flipping safe bet that daryl ha few brain cell here and there ,1
much hate what lebron say you guy realize had have been fed that crap the high ups find difficult believe actually belief the crap that came out his mouth ,1
only the radical get put into the camp not average uighur there are uighur celebrity movie industry and basketball okay imagine that religious radical group committing terrorist act the the government decides round them and educate them and deradicalize them too terrible the mistreatment also exaggerated the camp are worse than your average prison trust have friend from xinjiang they have good life uighur can good university thanks affirmative action yes they exist china and get good job easily too they receive benefit term education housing the radicalized one were actually influenced taliban major enemy ,1
don behave like fascist you don want called fascist ,1
the new unis are definite improvement but could you imagine they were wearing the throwback the cover instead ,1
couldn have said better myself sit down lebron ,1
look get what you saying but asking harden about this topic dumb dude here hoop not commentate global politics lebron response wa worse than not speaking because least understandable why someone wouldn speak that being said either both came out and said whatever you like the say the reality nothing would change except your post about ,1
this great ,1
what about james harden apology nobody want talk about this make just bad all the player and coach remaining silent bash all one none all ,1
wish would done arizona reference instead lmao ,1
insert pam the office same picture jpg meme ,1
doesn appease the chinese who will watch space jam ,1
okc should have offered some there for all those pick gave ,1
harden said wasn getting involved lebron went out his way throw morey under the bus ,1
then you are calling lance fascist even though you said you werent not offended but dont think you should call people fascist they are not fascist ,1
thank man really dislike your team and all your freaking championship but something are bigger than basketball texas should stand together this calling mavs ,1
harden could have not apologised behalf morey that basically saying morey wa the wrong could not say anything issue where not directly involved and can understand that same go for lebron and not about what wanted them say about implying that someone morey who said stood with freedom wrong and even though them not throwing morey under bus wouldn change the situation definitelly show they value their bag over someone right show support for just cause not trying nor willing crash with you here just stating that feel disapointed both harden and lebron their position this one right doesn cancel one wrong and glad they helped community even not affected but question that would happen big buck were the line ,1
pretty interesting see some this actually broken down like the look rus starting the corner such good cutter and strong rim attacker feel like able manufacture some easy bucket there ,1
please have heard lot here today but this ha gotta top dare ask your take mao and his great leap forward lol that had like year wisdom precluding according your math and logic lemme guess didn happen wa somehow really good thing ,1
damn you think soooooo big wow ,1
next level dude should politics but the number game can beat the reddit community downvotes lol ,1
yeah agree with you that seeing the same type comment over and over again get very stale yet people still eat ,1
damn hurt even more because with gerald age and how close already wa being out the league before snagged him missing whole year and having rehab major injury could career ending ,1
nobody liked mao for his policy yeah nobody denies that mao mistake that starved and killed million chinese people mao cultural revolution also set china back year economically mao wa mainly praised for his military strategy but not for his politics when deng took over mao denounced mao mistake well and cleared the name the leader persecuted deng wa the one chinese people are most thankful for opened china learn from the west and made china from what north korea and venezuela what china today one generation ,1
understand that part but doesn keep him from being seen hypocrite should taken his own advice and kept his mouth closed ,1
shredded brother ,1
you said wa same thing american did japanese after pearl harbor what the american did the japanese ppl the after pearl harbor wa wrong then and absolutely wrong now period radical religious group the ha member that are committing terrorist act the member that committed the terrorist act would put prison not the people that are member the radical religious group that didn commit terrorist act don fuck with that shit here you either committed criminal offense you didn you don get imprisoned here because joe schmo run your group and committed crime yes would terrible imprison person that didn commit abet terrorist act regardless alleged affiliation ,1
they love china ,1
this the mind blowing part ,1
agreed are being brigaded with downvotes but stay the course this make braver than lebron tbh ,1
absolutely think that lebron belief what said don think lebron give crap what going hong kong china political human right level and just see this highly inconvenient subject and belief that moray shouldn have said what did order protect the pocketbook the nba player and his personal sponsorship any higher ups would have seen the obvious nightmare his comment from mile away and would have just told him say comment like all other nba player are doing lebron just want focus basketball and his personal business and got fed with the china stuff and went off script ,1
don think these education camp are the eastern equivalent guantanamo bay dude just open your eye ,1
have geniune question for you all know harden and fertitta have decided side with money the issue though harden statement seems forced and maybe not his actual view but point stand morey can really credited have toppled the first domino fall expose these company and people that side with money over verbally supporting hong kong morally speaking how you feel supporting the rocket when some the figure head support money and the other support hong kong ,1
lebron did not even realize the hypocrisy spewing from his mouth seems don know maybe did know how hypocritical wa being ,1
not see sport team political activist group business have historically never been expected fight for human right and they never will don know why you hold the nba such high regard there are many more corporation with more resource that absolutely nothing but don see you others bitching about them even lebron wa pro china which not convinced well that his prerogative businessman not political ideologist who care support making more money that expected businessmen guess never seen him role model which might why not pissed but many others are ,1
don think they wa educated ,1
this unsettling but very well made ,1
clicked the link page doe not exist ,1
what did say wa deleted ,1
yikes ,1
always hated our link with china glad finally severed thanks morey for what needed said ,1
look like dipped out before the extra inning stated ,1
yank ,1
they couldn give those away they tried ,1
wa sitting tilman seat and this look like one those show your face earn grace thing ,1
left lol ,1
dipped the think wa yawning lol ,1
the guy all time great nba player you expect him entertained watching arguably the most boring sport the planet lmao ,1
like said baseball isn for everyone ,1
out million possibility this that one timeline where rus win chip with you guy ,1
your answer make seem like you never played basketball ,1
saying more hour till leave this boring as shit ,1
dude inning haul dude that like double overtime nba and low scoring too definitely will leave you bored have true loyalty any the team playing ,1
better though your example you got extra point but you also given the opposition more possession they would surely score from those free possession leading understand the premise just not the that extent ,1
think you have the roster right the money confident that mclemore make given guy like james comment him recently talking will the rotation especially now with green injured for the last way guy think will ray spalding even though haven seen him play yet blossomgame purely because those guy fit our need most ,1
obviously you never heard long format cricket golf ,1
yep don watch baseball but you have appreciate the greatness also because houston pride ,1
then left the ,1
wa gone after ,1
not valid million people can enjoy multiple sport pretty sure rus love bowling and that shit ain high octane think played baseball highschool too ,1
kinda pathetic but for his first mlb game did alright lol ,1
chinese jersey bro you stand with morey nah ,1
supporting ,1
for few inning ,1
yup surprised the rocket arent back beijing the all star break ,1
really need master the floater fucking hard stop combination with his lob game and just taking the rim steph curry obliterates people with hope harden can too ,1
aka the greatest ever sport ,1
cop even though not fan the chinese design ,1
excuse ignorence but aren all jersey made china ,1
you ever accidentally put your shirt backwards shit feel awkward folk used this purpose ,1
this wa twitter all last night mean who care ,1
best coach had since rudy yet somehow doesn get extended and ha bunch fan blaming him for the rocket not getting past the dub smh ,1
surprised tillman pay for astros ticket ,1
doe nene still have the team ,1
nah wa just speaking out for what right ,1
could certainly trade him sooner wanted clear roster spot but think morey prefers wait until the deadline that his contract can least match about worth salary needed need clarification exactly how all his incentive work now because seems like morey still ha option get that trade number higher desired depending how the game won incentive trigger ,1
dude been doing business with the chinese for more than decade know where their spot are also know what the potential backlash are for himself and others why now ,1
don think thinking china his twitter ,1
think wa jetlagged tired had some sake got too relaxed and forgot switch account most public figure got burner account ,1
rudy deserves hof ,1
best three year span for harden gordon and capela albeit injury too then ,1
unfortunately you not going find anything near mid court the range for any rocket game ,1
nah some feel aware the situation black and white including myself with business there and friend there but the timing and him that sort figure followed closely many nba fan china wa the perfect combustible mix not saying daryl doesn have burner for fun but just saying this scenario not likely because there reason for him voice something controversial only stay the shadow the type chime and folk like kerr have had somewhat success chiming this seemed different but indeed wa different hence everyone ha become hypersensitive and quiet lately while they try normalize the controversy whether that right wrong another issue ,1
lowe say the biggest snub and not even homer soon enough mike will deserve too not already tbh ,1
ben been putting overtime those midnight er the toyota center just hope that not tiring himself out but ha got the right mindset from have seen far make the team especially with green impending extended absence still haven seen the team put together game long solid defensive effort offense ha not been issue interested see what mid season early season trade are contemplated shore that that unless all the veteran piece shake their rust off and prove capable but still feel bit short ,1
way anticipated the chinese government react the way they did bunch pansy tell think about twitter blocked china but apparently they all still heard morey ,1
rissil wisbruk ,1
say the most likely thing that just didn think wa that big deal us social medium bunch and himself enough where this wa probably just situation where didn make the connection fast enough for how bad would taken the chinese mean kerr tweeted similar stuff and one batted eye maybe had just been reading the situation had chance tweet something out and just did without taking time weigh out the international implication when realized the shit storm quickly deleted after all had planned out what huge statement wa making tweeting would have surely left longer instead wa fast whoop bad ,1
you wanna fuk off ,1
nobody getting traded except eventually nen unless incredible deal arises won someone else will always beat capela and are the only realistic tradeable contract that could bring back someone worth trading for and don see that happening shuffling and combining vet min contract get value just assures are paying tax give this group get lot rope work thing out before dissing that line ,1
the stupid raaaaaaangz culture mda ha lead revolutionary offense separate generation player and probably doesn have ring simply due league bullshit amare suspension and injury hammy easily one the all time great ,1
went the suite ,1
probably doesn ,1
some bitch as chinese nba fan pasted daryl tweet chinese basketball forum that how this shit storm started ,1
lol dipped the too much anxiety for game did look bored though ,1
sad that neither you nor any the people you reference can recognize the very clear difference between migrant detainment center and nazi concentration camp even when lay them out for you plain day you really should ask for refund from harvard you clearly not even learned the basic discourse let alone logical reasoning ,1
this why basketball person need constant movement ,1
that case spur and mavs ,1
weren for that injury ,1
offer you sell them now ,1
baseball can boring but argue there nothing more tense and exciting than game elimination game late the playoff there reason the fall classic can you tell more exciting game recent history than game the ,1
will going and will try record much possible ,1
bummer those seat didn fan ,1
intense train sound ,1
wa thinking about going well ,1
best thing about being rich all the free shit you get ,1
smh ,1
yeah that where all the club seat are unfortunately ,1
you saint ,1
hour game lol ,1
mean rather watch play bowling than baseball baseball pretty boring and there can long period time where nothing happens and everyone just stand around lol ,1
reckon they would won tbh they were rolling ,1
think the obvious one this duo gonna work but honestly the one worry have westbrook and mda gonna mesh well seems like wa very high and didn want him traded will see they have good relationship may his last year since didn get extant and our owner seems have very little patient ,1
the uneducated person yeah they just standing around last night wa fucking intense pitching battle regardless when rus left the game and what wa doing all game proud that and his wife are embracing houston and went support another houston team during their playoff run that say lot about him even more doesn even like baseball ,1
there too ,1
time out didn make adjustment lost blaming him ask what adjustment the winning coach made what adjustment the losing coach could reasonably made foresight and watch how little you get back ,1
arrived after the game started too wasn too late but only notice him because saw girl camo jacket being ushered her seat during the first inning with some guy when she sat down looked the guy she wa with saw that wa wesbrook guess the camo jacket girl wa his wife ,1
stream anywhere ,1
the irony only being seen because camo jacket ,1
anyone whose gone the past few year they usually sign autograph ,1
only noticed because floating head way more out place than full person walking down the stair ,1
wish wa available stream ,1
dont think looked bored lol wa just chilling and taking all ,1
astros tipping pitch put the league notice ,1
tfw you have work ,1
have bigger issue with him slashing the rotation for the playoff after our energy guy have been such huge piece our team chemistry and our star get tired late game series ,1
look into the lower bowl near but even with say backboard those are seat and they are great experience try get the the term row ours are seat season ticker price slower night they can often close that amount ,1
cop they sold that chicago lol ,1
think can dispel the notion that not elite coach because hasn made final let alone won title the postseason far out performed expectation against gsw and literally wa hamstring injury away from title mda championship caliber coach far concerned ,1
,1
sure wear your free hong kong shirt the practice ,1
honestly doe make adjustment but mostly just minor adjustment really everyone tends just make minor adjustment when team make major adjustment they run the risk being ridiculed like the jazz wa for running gameplan that for all information given wa the correct gameplan ,1
from what have seen and how everyone ha acted far don have much worry that will work very least better than last season think bigger question how will the rocket treated will the china stuff effect the way they are officiated treated around the nba and medium game wise the biggest question defense will they able good enough defensively that they will able hang with clipper maybe their offense can good enough that doesn matter maybe tactic they might use when harden and westbrook are the floor together they have already shown some glimpse thing they might doing together ,1
yes would with well doesn mean bad coach just that not willing change thing the same can said for budenholzer for the buck honestly seen what adjustment series all you have look how nick nurse changed his defense giannis and how implemented box and one steph pop who arguably the greatest coach all time constantly making adjustment during playoff series ,1
biggest problem reliance three becomes incredibly predictable and james harden talented that should taking mid ranger especially late game situation where his leg start give and three become much harder ,1
hey rocket fan good thing that you fighting for free speech china but how about your own country http www youtube com watch jrxuoeugowu hypocrite ,1
ronnie ha always been stupid hell not surprise ,1
outside houston james harden the most hated player the nba when win that ring will shut these dumbass ,1
there reason fireronnie thing ,1
ronnie miss wide open layup shouldn talking ,1
not just fan seen countless former nba player say not great playoff coach how exactly elite coach need defense coordinator because his lack desire coach defense ,1
cricket baseball imo all you baseball chew dip the plate miss time and then sit down lol ,1
the biggest adjustment wa bench harden our sensational playoff win against the clipper this wa not only adjustment wa career threatening revolution turned out well see minor adjustment all the time but the team also ha some responsibility carry out ,1
game and the wcf last year were both marred some pretty bad coaching from mda not always just people making shit ,1
ronnie straight look like fucking mantis this video why the fuck are his eye buggy ,1
this the same guy who should prison for false advertisement ,1
ahead and cite specific example ,1
simply clown ,1
leaving nene the game the end game curry proceeds hit ahead pointer isolation over you guessed nene game the warrior ran the same play for the final minute and didn stop once you think timeout and defense adjustment could fix something like that specific enough for you buddy ,1
yeah le thinking involved basketball ,1
yeah curry hit the shot that what curry doe this look like pretty decent defense buddy http imgur com zys png not really sure what else you want happen steph curry pretty good don play the result play the process ,1
not good defense letting steph curry get point attempt off the end the game not good defense the thought process behind leaving nene during the final second defense terrible decision ,1
steph curry want get off steph curry going get off you kidding yourself thinking otherwise besides wa point game you chase him hard off the line you going give him wide open look from closer distance you don get baited foul for closing space quick nene got hand and gave good challenge the shot without fouling not anything else you can ask defender that situation curry miss that shot and win guarantee you you not saying mike messed also wa second game should not have had center the floor try and secure rebound small and can get board and lose are you not here killing mike for not having big man out there ,1
exactly everyone say fuck china but when anyone mention israel you get downvoted ,1
you actually believe there wa one else more capable defending stephen curry that situation mean seriously wa obvious mda messed having nene out there even that shot rim out ,1
who should have been then tell clint and faried were getting smoked should have been them maybe you think small ball that brilliant point game with second left let make sure have rim protection nor rebounding chance what your brilliant answer ,1
unreal you are pretending nene the best possible player have the game that situation capela and tucker both would have been better option ffs clark defends the perimeter better than nene ,1
can tell you all how concerned stupid self anyways ,1
because harden isn guy ,1
tucker wa originally curry but got screened and switched you got problem with that take with bzdelik because developed the scheme not mike clint wa getting embarrassed everyone the main reason lost the series clark fucking laughable and only the internet could you honestly suggest putting rookie who barely played all year steph curry the quarter wcf game that why mike get paid and you and swap dumb comment clark jesus come man ,1
joke you already favourited that sub ,1
the scheme wa not developed with fucking nene mind what are you not understanding about that the gary clark comment simply about putting nene inability defend guard context you can understand that then the conversation pointless ,1
this legit fake look like walmart knock off ,1
our scheme our scheme and our scheme matter who the floor you have problem with the switch blame bzdelik not mike what you not understand about that the gary clark comment wa the dumbest thing you said this conversation and just show you not actually able answer the question who should been the floor instead obvious done here ,1
ronnie literal joke not gonna take this seriously just because james doesn play his game ,1
our scheme our scheme and the player the floor crucial situation need the best one executing that scheme moron ,1
quite the report what did have for lunch ,1
right lmao what even this westbrook smelled fart rumor are with and fine like cmon now lmao ,1
deleted ,1
who ronnie ,1
reading you really missed opportune moment with your flair you could have wrote bother well there always next time ,1
did missed out lol brother ,1
all these comment and you called more name than you have provided alternative nene you let know when you figure one out better yet don this ha been utter waste time ,1
pat bev there ,1
for the pair ,1
sheesh ,1
lol nene your pick defend curry the end the game lol some people just can stfu and admit they are wrong ,1
crazy move still doe and ha many more move now ,1
same way harden elite player despite his lack desire play defense ,1
damn austin ,1
not pick you guy even understand how nba defense work you realize don get just select who want curry right you understand the play began with him and got picked and switch wa forced iso nene right you think any team pick their slow as center get iso harden fuck have you watched single rocket game ever some people need stfu themselves before opening their mouth and proving how dumb they are ,1
wish would but you already know anytime harden brought matter what muh travel muh free throw hope for the final game doesn make single shot but make free throw just trigger the hater lmao ,1
steph floater strike fear into very soul ,1
unlike the average know all that will check with their valuable opinion mda coaching ability going admit that don have enough information make educated statement this know for fact that mda capable making adjustment general his team houston look nothing like the team had phoenix particularly term pace for game adjustment don have access what tell the player for all know trying make adjustment but his team just can doesn them successfully what know for sure that something ha been incredibly successful for long time that choosing the most critical moment the season ignore and something else seems like pretty strange choice work thing look great but doesn work either then the second guessing one proven philosophy look way waaayyy worse than the alternative losing all time great like the spur the early and the warrior over the past couple year nothing ridiculed for especially when luck and interesting officiating have played such active role ,1
bother ,1
str edit have the astros the brain still ,1
yeah think can get used this ,1
nice ,1
suck that the only jersey have now the chinese one from last year ,1
dont think he ever missed them ,1
harden already said fuck when went with nba live lol ,1
you act like antoni popovich level good coach but don act like doesn have major flaw ,1
lol you probably right about that either way ,1
dude just blind mda fan boy ,1
lmfao not only that answered james harden response first player that come mind when say overrated ,1
overrated how bow dah ,1
nice where ,1
when did say wa pop level fwiw even pop blow the call sometime doe nobody remember duncan not being the floor when the heat got the oreb that lead the ray allen shot some you need learn there more coaching than lose bad ,1

jfc ,1
yea danuel house pretty good ,1
think wa leaving early catch the astros game ,1
lmaoooo ,1
savage ,1
depends whose fart really ,1
you didn say that but your post seems that you believe mda beyond criticism kinda hard put him top coach when ha been known not care about defense and team have had resort hiring defensive coordinator due his lack desire coach defense ,1
who dis ,1
not fighting for free speech china fighting for free speech here the main issue that china effectively censoring american american soil ,1
did you watched video any another video with that topic your country creating new law make boycott israel illegal your state believe you from texas already illegal that how that normal you criticize china china doesn work with you you criticize israel you will not get aid work some state ,1
never said beyond criticism merely pointed out why having nene that point wasn egregious mistake ,1
don live texas aware that bill yes whats your point you realize people are fighting against that law right people can aware and care about several thing once ,1
perhaps you right never seen anyone fighting against that law israel censorship any website but almost every website see this china topic csgo reddit gag discord and etc you say people are unhappy and fighting with that too bad personaly never seen ,1
that scenery really look like the part when you pas conroe ,1
raymond felton ,1
wa all over the texas sub several conspiracy sub saw stuff about facebook there were article written about challenge from texas politician who don agree with there way that thing gonna pas either le immediate issue than china government using economic power keep american from talking negatively about ,1
twitter illegal china make sense his tweet shouldn available law abiding chinese right ,1
harden did nba live few year ago sure ha now grudge right ,1
whoever felton delted ,1
yep nothing between and okc all ,1
dealt with china for over decade know where the landmines are the idea that didn think there would reaction silly ,1
alright now really gotta beat the lakers ,1
yikes ,1
how hypocritical ,1
lebron wumao confirmed what fucking twat one thing use the don know enough comment way evade all this another basically throw morey under the bus for supporting civil right all for chinese money whatever respect had for lebron ha all been removed from system fuck him what fucking po ,1
video big yikes http twitter com markg medina status ,1
new headline lebron becoming senile ,1
wonder someone asked lebron what morey wa misinformed about sound like lebron upset about his money got space jam ticket sell ,1
lol misinformed and uneducated pretty sure morey educated about the situation and know what happening there wrong lebron and these player are basically selling their soul for money ,1
that another guy who used look and one favorite nba player taking the chinese money before human right really disheartening see all this clearly lebron doesn need more money and really had the best opportunity take stand here disappointed ,1
you whack any those cushion seat hard enough dust will fly out ,1
what are these player looking for fine suspension this pretty darn unique situation without precedent think silver doing fine job tbh ,1
mean lebron making semi sensible answer here china best walk with even more care than normal those circumstance that said would have been easier say that himself wa not educated the situation pull kerr curry everyone else and next question instead coming out with this clear pander ,1
wa big fan lebron but hate him now ,1
nope getting ready play golden state ,1
what fucking clown lost ton respect for this man ,1
lebron james bitch you say ,1
before get the pitchfork out bron ha clarified that meant morey wa misinformed not grasping the full aftermath what wa doing not misinformed about the situation ,1
pretty sure lakers got home sunday hence him finally speaking the medium medium availability while china ,1
have alternate take this the nba china most followed sport not the nfl not mlb not soccer nba and the team they follow the houston rocket china just erased the most popular team china scorched them from the annual outlawed citizen from showing support erased them from history pulled all rocket merchandising from store they aren going forget easily once the season start people there will want follow their team let the regular season start winning change everything ,1
lebron james fucking coward ,1
lebron the one that misinformed ,1
lbj fucking lmao ,1
man came over the rocket community because rus but quickly started like morey would have never imagined that would the factor make people turn lebron fucking love this man fuck lebron til infinity ,1
plenty informed but being the right side history and taking stand would cost him money probably won long until tell one his boy tag his gate with some pro graffiti like when one them put the word there year ago ,1
fair but lbj quote even with that clarification basically say thanks lot daryl for costing chunk money ,1
yeah kind dick move but get where coming from that ,1
that long winded way begging china watch space jam ,1
don defend this nonsense ,1
lebron said freedom speech good but that bag even better smh ,1
lol not surprised ,1
what you guy think protestors beating the shit out this old woman http worldstarhiphop com android video php wshhkgxwo gafdu wa she opressing them ,1
lmao actually made laugh out loud ,1
fuck lebron and fuck morey life team hong kong ,1
yeah but the first thing brings morey tweet affecting financials wouldn surprised lebron call for morey resign because his brand get hurt china ,1
folded would say the jersey support the chinese sweat shop with fake course ,1
beat ,1
held special meeting china with the net and lakers discus the morey situation with adam silver while there they then cancelled all interview while china opinion lebron probably called the meeting try and get morey fired ,1
compare what lebron the social justice leader say what harden who rarely ever make social commentary said all have freedom speech that the world live said harden according reuters everyone should say how they feel and their thought process able speak obviously some people are going feel some type way others are going agree that just the world live here for adam silver how did harden make better statement than lebron james ,1
the whole nba turned morey way last the entire season unfortunate but out just matter when ,1
believe actually ha pair testicle and thusly chose stand against censorship and communist rule over million people that want democracy and spoke ,1
this situation complicated with lot cultural and historical ramification not easy good evil calling everyone who recognizes wumao and brainwashed just ignorant think part the problem are the incredibly divergent viewpoint how the west can look hong kong tibet taiwan etc somehow apart from china while everyone china view these place integral and inseparable part the chinese identity call brainwashing whatever but strongly believe that every citizen should have political voice they believe that these place are inseparable part china not necessarily the political identity but the cultural identity just quick explainer how chinese people view these place hong kong stolen via war aggression and unfair treaty taiwan would have been united with china except chose support the kuomintang their puppet world wide ideological conflict against the ussr tibet conquered and absorbed part china since dynastic time year exact tibet ha been part chinese history longer then the ha been country tibet did gain defacto independence from however the opinion the chinese this condition doe not represent tibet independence many other part china also enjoyed facto independence when the chinese nation wa torn warlordism japanese invasion and civil war after the fall qing dynasty during this time that the dali lama tried establish independent theocracy external influence may have some effect but barring some global catastrophe personally feel move away from authoritarianism can only spring from within honestly how china ruled ha not changed for couple thousand year with strong reliance enlightened dictator and the rule the wise instead rule the law the emphasis personal connection for getting thing done instead codified process cultural sticking point that literally hasn changed for thousand year the introduction communism basically got married the part chinese culture and philosophical thought that always had deference authority stressing order and collective good over personal freedom for people protest just issue freedom but for most chinese people hongkong problem part the territorial consistency the whole country especially when some protestors wave and national flag protest this sense for mainland chinese people when business man who earn money from china openly support the freedom hong kong make them recall the colonized experience happened before when the country territory wa carved the main capitalist country the world this century humiliation why china reacts defensively and forcefully when they feel like their territorial consistency challenged you might think the chinese people brainwashed badly but every country ha it political cultural taboo matter what reason creates this taboo ,1
fuckin snitch ,1
get out here you fucking china shill ,1
damn hate say because never been that hate train but now fuck lebron james ,1
lebron hate freedom ,1

king james more like qing james ,1
appreciate the long thought out argument you drawn here but that besides the point people take issue with how china generally conduct it business oppressive totalitarian regime and hong kong well within it right demand the retention it civil liberty given that the two government one country system something prc also agreed this another case opposing side valuing different thing and misunderstanding each other not for the video police use excessive force and china history making their dissenter disappear tiananmen square basically zedong entire reign this issue would probably not big would but stand china seems value it territory more than value human life matter the cultural context that highly immoral that why pretty much nobody who doesn have vested capital interest the market china isn mainland chinese side with china definitely deplorable for lot their valuation land and personal image over human right not even mentioning the current situation with uighur muslim violates lot our moral principle perhaps the worst all when major american brand both company and individual kowtow china attempt save their dollar don care how sensitive china about their territory because they haven been very sensitive about other nation life and people either they are not more important than those who live tibet taiwan hong kong ,1
found the chinese rocket fan ,1
kid don drug ,1
least harden had metaphoric gun his head ,1
lebron could just said comment ,1
morey basically brought half the advanced statistic into the game and partly responsible for ushering this new era three and layup ,1
imgur tag ,1
not saying that daryl wrong that what happening the fault the protestors not being pro anti china just saying that what daryl morey did wa fucking stupid because shouldn tweeting that kind stuff saying that daryl had known what wa going happen then wouldn have done and that definition mean that wasn education the situation again the situation meaning using social medium talk about chinese politics general not believe there wa any consideration for the consequence and ramification the tweet not discussing the substance others can talk about that james said tweet ,1
first with the melo stuff now this ,1
more than athlete unless money involved fuck lebron you misinformed and uneducated ,1
you ever watched winnie the pooh ,1
nah bro too far ,1
fuck lebron ,1
fair point and can argue any just simply stating that lebron and others aren wrong and shouldn receive heat for this and don agree with the perspective are kowtowing china when you operate another country you operate within the law and cultural perimeter that country not the job multi national company enact social and political change every country the world for china respecting other country they actually follow foreign policy five principle peaceful coexistence mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity mutual non aggression non interference each other internal affair equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence the chinese leadership originally enumerated these principle when china with communist government wa trying reach out the non communist country asia copy and pasted from http afe easia columbia edu special china forpol principle htm ,1

child ,1
stop defending this dumbass ,1
when you station life where people are putting microphone your face asking you weigh heavy topic you have two option answer that you yourself don have enough information comment take stance based the information you have anyone with brain heart know that china committing human right violation right and left anyone with freedom speech ball would take the stance that morey did lebron said morey wa thinking about himself when tweeted what did but that lie morey wa thinking about the people hong kong and risking his livelihood speak out their defense lebron now thinking about himself and siding with china avoid risking his own livelihood being the situation right now for lot these guy who represent the nba doe suck and feel bad for them being pressured for soundbites but doesn suck bad doe hong kong right now and that what morey had the ball say that lebron didn his non answer wa pussy cop out should all see through ,1
extremely ,1
but earned great amount money ,1

lol mit baby there visiting and recruiting ,1
like our james better ,1
thought james harden wa criticized before for his initial comment siding with china though ,1
nah lol most the ingredient are from here not just talking about panda express but the real deal stuff here socal and nyc ,1
lebron ha made clear that not siding with china just political tweet general and most people probably see what china doing human right violation that doesn mean that make good business sense take stance you can see that siding with china you want the nba however business not human right group not sure where the expectation for them speak coming from that wa the case then they should speaking about the too have ton problem the have cop killing innocent unarmed people and mass shooting more often than monthly you want worry about china fine but there are problem your own hometown that the nba can talk about too china just the topic the day ,1
check out the twitter comment lol ,1
used the right form their trolll ,1
silver said morey isn getting fired tilman said morey isn getting fired harden said support morey speaking his mind morey isn going anywhere ,1

wow wow wow with the barbershop how those feel waiting for the pink lemonade the but might just need get the barbershop hold over the court ,1
waiting for the candy paint personally they should come just time for school season hopefully ,1
they feel great they are true size and are very comfortable for walking haven played yet they dropped today walked into champ grab and then saw the jersey thought grab both probably shouldn spend anymore money lol the pink lemonade and the candy paint are dope too but probably wait until another unreleased colorway drop you wanna know more about them check out weartesters review them easily the best shoe review the planet http youtu caib ,1
spoon fed john wall ,1
where did you get the jersey ,1
hell naw they are going break the core and get rid would rather them after kat something butler already decided just chill his own team they don really need him much anymore anyway would fit le and that would gut the roster too much ,1
champ willowbrook mall wa trying the shoe and turned look for the guy that handed them and saw them rack turned them over make sure they were for real and they were they also had our new red unis but only saw harden maybe they had westbrook but wasn really looking for his and didn see ,1
midrange not really the problem the long two that they really don want they got the first place seemingly help with more midrange production the conversion rate long not worth the shot two shot from that range give point but two shot just one two step back point which basically extra shot without taking one for the conversion rate balance out they would have shoot much higher rate than shooting from just few step back most people don plummet far make the le valuable than long and driving and being able force defender account for guarding the rim help create more space for shooter ,1
that wa great thorough video haha the jersey idk how supposed stay stock but guess they forecasted appropriately harden prob got some fire color way unveil the middle and later part the season can wait ,1
the bonus rokit mine from the team store rocketsshop com ha the sponsor logo but couldn wait lol ,1
great explanation how doe one keep track the point each week ,1
tweet http twitter com dreamshakesbn status ,1
tweet http twitter com kdtrey status ,1
when somehow got favorite player coming out college maryland that year whom thought wa cross iverson handle shotmaking and quickness and vince hop wa hoping for baron davis stevie ,1
source the changed language nobody talked about revolution only about their democratic right they were demonstrating for suddenly outsider are propagandizing free ,1
wrong state ,1
they keep track all automatically you don have anything other than set your lineup ,1
yes saw the one the team store but wa hesitant buy because the sponsor obviously fine with the nike logo but not fan jersey covered sponsor like soccer jersey when saw these champ wa pleasantly surprised also heard but haven found any evidence online that the galleria they were doing thing where you bought the shoe you got free haircut and apparently harden showed idk that what heard clue real not ,1
depth egotistical star ,1
,1
pick yudai baba from the waiver wire and reel some japanese fan ,1
umm take you didn get the news hassan portland ,1
same ,1
dont think that khwaii chose the clipper solely the fact that montrez harell wa there but understand what you are saying who know what other domino move but the same time maybe while are missing all those three against gsw montrez feasting the paint and end winning the game and beating the cavs and winning title ,1
worked last year when the floater abandoned harden ,1
know wa that game well pretty sad lol ,1
damm dont even know that guy ,1
weird how stockton malone and payton kemp didnt make the list growing were told those guy were god ,1
houston always tends find undersized gem ,1
same haha let know you find out ,1
this based last season one know how many assist those guy have made each other come off like you never seen them play and get upset when people talk positively about their skill because you didn see yourself ,1
looking fresh ,1
considering moral bankruptcy often requirement for billionaire status this disappointingly unsurprising ,1
shit lmao time change mine ,1
harden wa definitely stoned out his mind this show ,1
only thing want point out with this the messenging might worded fuck the chinese government otherwise can come across like saying fuck all chinese people ,1
the guy the left that augustine from missouri city and went ,1
this wa awesome video thanks for posting ,1
think you guy are jumping false pretense some these report organ harvesting date back year ago whether still going inconclusive would like official response from the pentagon not rag team group journalist like the chinese tribunal they even said their finding weren clear enough make positive ruling http imgur com pnaigpu ,1
nice ,1
great ,1
dammit time for mclemore and house step ,1
well fuck ,1
hate see ,1
time for ben mclemore step ,1
oof ouch ,1
nooo fuck wa doing well wish him speedy recovery ,1
wa this the preseason against playing player the preseason ,1
damn during practice ,1
fuck already starting ,1
fuck hope fully recovers miss you while you gone greenlight ,1
one hand feel bad for him but doe suck and wa only holding the team back from finding and playing better player ,1
this mean mclemore will get roster spot replacement ,1
sheet ,1
gmm lah ,1
excuse ,1
literally only ha one skill rotation level and taking can anything else all ,1
could have been either that practice maybe the offseason just didnt know but it hard against playing player the preseason mainly because getting your rotation down minute for the first half least play etc it team like the warrior from who knew what they have term curry klay draymond and then shouldnt issue but youre integrating new player overall you have play the guy ,1
depending where the foot broken key for recovery hopefully just fracture ,1
macmahon ben mclemore had already positioned himself earn roster spot with green injury rocket might need mclemore play significant bench minute http twitter com espn macmahon status ,1
nooooo ,1
greenhouse for the foreseeable future ,1
get out here don want you ,1
just telling the truth tell where wrong hope get healthy but terrible nba player ,1
are you fucking shitting right now ,1
mod this one right here ,1
suck hope can recover and ready for the late season and post season ,1
gone ,1
with regard for human life ,1
speedy recovery come back stronger than ever ,1
anytime fam glad you enjoyed ,1
laker fan but hope green get back healthy big role player you guy think will affect your record that much ,1
lol little rest before the next run ,1
look like the second game japan after that outback dunk limped off and must have been thoroughly evaluated after returning houston ,1
dammit want rus gerald oops ,1
seems like the issue starting die down purely because people are bored when the season start probably will barely mentioned again ,1
thing with green that must lead the league weak as foul streaky player must admit wish they would put him see hot not immediately bench even healthy prefer mcclemore getting the minute ,1
yeah thanks for this point updoot ,1
god please not sweet gerald ,1
love some gerald green but going far harden and westbrook can take guard might the position can best deal with injury ,1
yeah you not rocket fan ,1
long ready for the playoff hope heals well and get full energy hope shine brightly the playoff ,1

cant you use the arena editing tool find ,1
fracture you know what never mind ,1
the term are actually interchangeable and both refer bone that ha been shattered often excessive force ,1
obi swag kenobi ,1
early style did not age well know you can probably say that about lot time period but least other time they wore properly fitting clothes ,1
gerald take left foot ,1
yeah everyone look like kid that got into their dad clothes ,1
well shit ,1
think three and layup are the best shot take but when you miss three row playoff game you should probably throw couple mid range keep the defense honest there are few idea thing going with this argument firstly talking about the context where you are just cold from the point line and not necessarily jacking heavily contested mda would still say that you have let them shoot through because the nature being more variable shot compared mid range shot there will almost certainly high point and low point and the worst thing you can point shooting team let streak missed row detur you from shooting more and coach you definitely shouldn say you miss amount row stop taking them and try get easy basket because that can mess with the confidence player now talking about gary clark shooting situation where sub from the field over the course the whole season yeah maybe let him get his percentage before let him just shoot willy nilly but people like harden green gordon even westbrook they should never discouraged from taking good point shot relatively open one now there second aspect the original quote where case where you have team like utah that defending the really well and defending the paint really well okay that case you might have consider taking mid range jumper although part the problem with that outside harden there are very few people the team that can hit that shot with any level efficiency would probably try run play get open get look around the rim that even guy like gobert ha hard time defending ,1
hell bargain ,1
but would say even harden that situation where pull midrange shot even open don know what the percentage are but wouldn surprise that le than shot for him and that point you might well just dribble out the point line with only defender him and for the step back even semi contested that like shot least for harden ,1
flash seat ,1
holy shit that steal ,1
ughhhhhhhhh ,1
fuck preseason ,1
that major come ,1
cowboy fan still dress like this lol ,1
,1
aaron brook and kyle lowry also same height calvin murphy ,1

dang imma search socal nike outlet once back from boston nyc business trip ,1
looked like wa bored the whole time baseball isn for everyone guess ,1
yeah because baseball pretty boring sport for dude who play high octane basketball ,1
kill ,1
agreed like not the center morey kicked off there going back sure once the team get back the state there will good amount support controversy the first pregames back not going away anytime soon ,1
free agent would take le money but the money they have the book would greater proportion ,1
honestly don disagree but the analytical approach layup and yield more point per shot than midrange jump shot the problem with approach like this game average and statistic don necessarily tell the whole story ,1
think about going from better than going shooting midrange shot you want take the high percentage efficient shot drive the rim are generally more efficient than mid range shot pointer are worth more than mid range shot team that go shoot from mid range can still lose team that shot from and layup are just more efficient ,1
the jazz series remind did win ,1
lmao that huge ,1
say forced three pointer than the open midrange sound better but think the three aren necessarily forced into contested attempt but forced term passing open long the analytics still sort out until there way chase shooter off the line because that pervasive then maybe the pendulum swing the other way cost benefit analysis risk based model that the risk take three result higher probability better outcome for example point per possession than open long two probably butchered this choppy as attempted explanation but hope some make sense lmao ,1
stan for officially favorite non starter atm ,1
yeah but james wa struggling bit because the defense they were playing the buck were doing the same thing the way they were defending him wa force him take midrange shot ,1
yeah for sure him blossoming into being playoff viable would tremendous hopefully rolling during the regular season and can get lotsa work and get better while and nene man the massage table have everybody dialed come the shitshow ,1
yeah understand your main premise through the course the game just talking about certain situation look this pic for example pic http amp businessinsider com image jpg tucker open that good option but the lob and layup not ingles already forced him off the line opinion the midrange there for harden ,1
never understood why people say the three the most efficient shot the easiest shot take but believe the most efficient shot the midrange and the layup ,1
add onto your point even though only been pre season game westbrook shooting more instead midranges ha drastically improved his efficiency although would very hard le efficient than westbrook wa last season his over these game despite still struggling from ,1
steve kerr private photo session http imgur com npzs jpg ,1
yep even though been rusty for the preseason the highest been his career and that when okc took warrior expect his above league average especially with all the spacing around him cutting out those mid range shot will wonder for his efficiency ,1
trump the low hanging fruit for kerr curry lebron they all fucking coward ,1
mda not probably are the best the world what lol ,1
such hypocrite found out today retweeted multiple pro stuff few month back and now all sudden doesnt know enough comment ,1
coward ,1
game wa anomaly and doesn factor the fact that scott foster decided waive off made shot the midst that stretch for reason you don ignore the year worth data because one fluke game ,1
tucker led least some point don feel like checking finished there the league corner your saying you rather harden shoot midrange over the defensive player the year than have tucker get open corner ,1
why people say the three the most efficient shot because mathematically proven fact not about what you believe not opinion ,1
there wa plenty available minute for guy come and play mpg only you assume that nene and faried doesn step single foot the floor and ignore the fact that mda would still run four guard lineup for large stretch the game won assume that because although wa just spot minute they both played well and the guard lineup played well can handle well shumpert not much again the team rebounding wa nearly identical the previous season despite not replacing the pfs and the warrior don run big lineup either not saying wa perfect fit played great not saying wouldn have rather had green saying not something rage fertita over think cost championship how would have got porter knight and chriss would not have even been close even let alone better return for the wizard than jabari and portis and not like you could throw bunch pick the wizard because theyre too inept blow their team both would have instantly been the best guy our rotation porter would have started but couldn get him ,1
that really funny coming from ha give his opinion everything ,1
the right play pas tucker there were situation that series tho where ran and forced floater and lob that got deflected also that gobert not very close all that plenty room get off clean look ,1
aren slaughtering muslim not way comparable ,1
fav move ,1
least they starting wake ,1
his height ,1
sam presti left the chat ,1
this stupid comparison people keep bringing how about you not millionaire with wide audience didn need shit china simply support daryl morey right free speech our country ,1
the only thing necessary for the triumph evil for good men nothing ,1
millionaire suffering it terrible problem ,1
the just evil sorry not acting like are superior ,1
steve kerr fit very well with that piece shit franchise ,1
height pretty hard disadvantage overcome expecally the nba also during the dradr team can have the hope prospect can work their fundimentals their shot really just add some muscle get them nba ready much harder draft guy and hope for all that and that god decided put late growth spurt their gene ,1
daryl morey just exposed progressive corporation and people lol morey amazingly bold man ,1
have the right call trump huge idiot and not get vanished organ are not being yanked out while struggling may not get everything right the but morally yeah say are pretty superior you idiot ,1
then simply answer the question which the fact you take issue with already answered that simply learn basic reading comprehension you realize there written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong right check again you objectively wrong yes aware and checked before said that because unlike you actually double check make sure what saying correct and not just spewing bullshit original comment this thread apparently not wanting more than double ariza salary make him cheap you respond not paying more than the minimum replace the rotation forward lost ariza luc and ryno what make him cheap when signing trade doesn work out tilmans fault but ennis shumpert who didn make the minimum the way had turned out good addition something tell you wouldn have given him any the credit you when tilman not only doesn let morey upgrade the roster but actively make the roster worse because his repeater tax decree like said you were the first one bring morey check again reading not hard and you said there record these thing you can back and check you don get that role big forward wa never properly replaced but that isn reason enough say fuck tilman and say sabotaging the team that massive overreaction and keep saying morey need bare the majority blame for that the cost cutting deadline move came when were fighting for morey could have got better replacement before the season started fault that the reason had more problem the main problem last year were what injury capella struggling the playoff everyone but harden having slow start house holding out all them stayed there would still injury capella would have still struggled the playoff house might not have ever been called guess that problem gone for slow start over the first qtr last season ariza averaged and ryno had and luc wa injured not exactly lighting btw you should use number including regular season gauge the impact those guy not last year you really shouldn because ariza wouldn again luc wouldn healthy again and anderson never regained his pre injury form thats why barely played the playoff there zero reason assume that would regain that form when couldn why would use their salary hit judged off their production you understand that minimum salary guy don need salary matched right could misunderstanding this but still listed with the mil incentive which wa under the impression counted towards matching salary maybe they just didn update after whatever the nba ruling wa but checked few salary tracking website and still listed this could but doubt although this meaningless there are player that actually make the minimum the roster then explain how they aren what comment you think not addressing looked through this multiple time and have clue what you referring will emphasize again since you seem understand point that the issue wa not retaining those player the issue wa not using ryno contract the mle replace the role ryno role shoot not rebounder despite the height good defender don need add anyone get more off just play gordon and gerald more which did plus house ennis river shot well ,1
will address other part your response later but for now just give simple yes answer whether not you agree with these fact the comment you can seem locate were very close winning most team would all those circumstance and try upgrade the roster however possible the mle and ryno contract were our only way upgrade the roster without moving core player trade but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax the final team the tax paying era have paid luxury tax and champion let major minute filling forward taller and replaced their minute with minimum contract signing and eventually iman shumpert who had played guard virtually his entire career that point due least part being small league standard who wa the only player emerge from ryno contract after all the dealing wa done and not likely signed this season those fact where you disagree ,1
holy shit ,1
this real the nba will approve ,1
can you atleast clarify whether not this satire lmao ,1
lol ,1
implies not real ,1
damn those would been sick lmao ,1
the nba doesn even wanna talk about hong kong doubt they would ever consider this ,1
,1
not the ,1
this shit would sell out people protest wearing this sht ,1
lived china for bit when wa kid early back than uncle loved wake early the morning and watch china version sportscenter and clearly remember that back then the intro wa filled with montage from yao ming and the rocket majority the soundtrack for the intro wa rocket man elton john didn know elton back then but thought the song wa beautiful listen the early morning became casual rocket and nba fan because really like yao ming not just because his chinese but also his sense humour said that his favourite song wa the american anthem because listens time during the season and his playing style when retired due long term injury feel bit sad thanked uncle for exposing nba and basketball both sport play and sport spend your pastime watching with all that said think that the recent controversy between rocket and china should not have happened what mean that the morey tweet could have been great window for young chinese fan truly understand what going with more objective and critical lens but the way the government and certain chinese fan the internet handled really disappointed but guess majority you blessing disguise since exposed you lot the dark stuff that going china feel bad that this turned out that way because there are lot people china who simply want enjoy basketball the rocket and the nba and now they got stuck hard place that just perspective ,1
lmao ,1
you acquire player that better than nen faried why would they play over him don use idiotic argument just argue parker and portis don play for washington they clearly weren the reason the wiz traded away porter wa strictly salary dump knight and chriss also would have decreased their salary commitment and while yes pick would have needed too not like didn send out pick anyways maybe the wiz don like that deal despite clearly not being contention this year and being good spot any for knight try regain his play but extremely disingenuous assume couldn have made trade work out had wanted try could have least brought sacramento and sent shumpert expiring washington too they chose dump salary over getting the pick there were absolutely multiple better deal offer washington than the pure salary dump they opted for were willing pay the price ,1
the classic chinese character houston jersey like before only one that say free hong kong mandarin much more direct china lol ,1
where did you hear see the info about him retweeting pro stuff you remember interested ,1
read comment one the thread nba here you woah just read now actually seems quite direct and not his only tweet the matter kerr ha shared link for thing going china too few year ago seems shame pretending not know anything about the country now for reference the tweet that kerr retweeted said http twitter com claytravis status bibi backsliding boris flailing hong kong rising the authotorian trend not inevitable fight back will work and from few year ago kerr directly tweeted this http twitter com simonsperling status great read and her complicated relationship with her fan and the chinese goverment china tennis rebel kerr ,1
wow how convenient for kerr thanks for the link and quick reply btw ,1
biggest coward ever only dare criticise his own president but not the president another country can not see the irony this himself can not tell something not right when this happens ,1
totally agree with you friend standing for justice freedom and democracy right thing when part the world are censoring itself have bigger need stick out neck out voice out this the true value freedom expression and how civilised society should decided not talk about ourselves that mean bowing down ccp and the totalitarian dictatorship remember that exactly what the ccp want make everyone uneasy unable talk about thing they don approve ,1
actually see banned china bad honour think should wear proudly being banned totalitarian state nothing ashamed ,1
agreed think about the reason china acting this way they just want everyone not talk about because international attention and pressure embarrassing inconvenience for them why should help making their wish come true ,1
for the time being rather happy about people taking stand against that totalitarian regime china also appreciate all the work you put into this post this sub ha the best mod any sport subreddit agree with you totally these point ,1
great suggestion there would love see this become thing ,1
love ,1
great design ,1
honestly would cop one look great ,1
big all time leading scorer for freshman record still hold never hurt his wrist and ralph sampson could control his impermissible texting and avoided being fired that team wa clicking and way should they lost the first round arkansas ,1
cause they sleepin ,1
glad they sleeping because this dude beast ,1
this picture disturbing ,1
this isn real ,1
waiting for the dhgate drop ,1
may have the right but not the totalitarian regime support genius ,1
agree with your jazz example because that wa extreme and simple high ball screen into mid range jumper would have been perfect get some point but most time mid range shot aren completely open and can find better shot ,1
then simply answer the question which the fact you take issue with already answered that simply learn basic reading comprehension answer first response directly then yes yes you need say nothing more but you want express the issue you have with any then please explicit about which word phrase you take issue with and whether not you agree with the other aspect maybe even provide alternate fact you see you realize there written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong right check again you objectively wrong yes aware and checked before said that because unlike you actually double check make sure what saying correct and not just spewing bullshit okay bad you right that one original comment this thread apparently not wanting more than double ariza salary make him cheap you respond not paying more than the minimum replace the rotation forward lost ariza luc and ryno what make him cheap when signing trade doesn work out tilmans fault but ennis shumpert who didn make the minimum the way had turned out good addition something tell you wouldn have given him any the credit you when tilman not only doesn let morey upgrade the roster but actively make the roster worse because his repeater tax decree like said you were the first one bring morey check again wa responding incorrectly that how go down than morey the one suggesting sign ennis whoever yet you give him the blame but it austin river fertita sign off you give morey the credit that the issue that the point not any the other paragraph bullshit you typed this bug way bigger way than dropping his name once peripheral example and then forgetting about because wa inconsequential main point hadn put any mental focus whatsoever you assert that the issue but not not even close the issue not even considering any level and you want say morey blame too then all for said many time this sub that the biggest mistake his tenure tbf got new one now bad streak for him but the point that this thread had never credited morey one way the other and even had far from the issue the issue that our team getting worse and that because are actively making worse effort avoid the tax and tilman very publicly threatened morey job security paid too much tax pretty clear connection that morey would try cut cost keep him happy and tilman ha been rubber stamping every step the way opposed suggesting actually maximize our championship chance paying for some depth provide james with the best roster possible least second playable forward reading not hard and you said there record these thing you can back and check you don get you say weird how weird make perfect sense compare see how the roster wa affected under his leadership that role big forward wa never properly replaced but that isn reason enough say fuck tilman and say sabotaging the team well never said either those thing response much more muted understand his team with plea but sure way more than enough that massive overreaction not harden prime ticking away and just wasted mvp level season and keep saying morey need bare the majority blame for that the cost cutting deadline move came when were fighting for morey could have got better replacement before the season started wish had and yeah screwed last off season too but the trade deadline wa the most critical moment because morey assured many time not the team you have october but the one march that matter fault that the reason had more problem the main problem last year were what injury capella struggling the playoff everyone but harden having slow start house holding out all them stayed imma stop you right there said multiple time that don fault letting them fault not replacing the role thought were looking for upgrade but apparently they were fine with downgrading meant better bottom line there would still injury capella would have still struggled the playoff house might not have ever been called guess that problem gone for slow start over the first qtr last season ariza averaged and ryno had and luc wa injured not exactly lighting btw you should use number including regular season gauge the impact those guy not last year you really shouldn because ariza wouldn again luc wouldn healthy again and anderson never regained his pre injury form thats why barely played the playoff there zero reason assume that would regain that form when couldn why would use their salary hit judged off their production you understand that minimum salary guy don need salary matched right could misunderstanding this but still listed with the mil incentive which wa under the impression counted towards matching salary those only count hit game played threshold won unless are really searching pay him more have other center possibility the end the year and need win team for them kick will waived mid february the second year kick and won the only question will traded for something nothing but something won big something unless combined with other player maybe they just didn update after whatever the nba ruling wa but checked few salary tracking website and still listed this could but doubt lol although this meaningless there are player that actually make the minimum the roster yeah your point then explain how they aren what comment you think not addressing looked through this multiple time and have clue what you referring yeah before you reply any the pointless bullcrap this comment back and give the yes answer the fact they are critical the actual point unlike who typed the word morey first will emphasize again since you seem understand point that the issue wa not retaining those player the issue wa not using ryno contract the mle replace the role ryno role shoot not rebounder despite the height good defender don need add anyone get more off just play gordon and gerald more which did plus house ennis river shot well note that none the guy you mentioned ever spent time our small ball despite what you think height matter ,1
this insanely stupid the slogan not free hong kong but democratic hong kong solidarity with hong kong will not free there are contract the one state two system status for the next year which guarantee democratic freedom calling for revolution exactly what china criticizes and will crush once you would the same ,1
hard for people grasp that ,1
think three and layup are the best shot take but when you miss three row playoff game you should probably throw couple mid range keep the defense honest think that healthy shot diet the playoff something like three unless you hot then shoot more than that shot the rim and mid range almost none when the team hot from three and more than hand full for when they aren hot from three the way team defend mid range are open shot math doesn matter nearly much the playoff due the small sample size that point the only thing that matter putting the ball the bucket any way possible ,1
you guy are missing the point why rioting ha nothing with democracy and everything with the evil unregulated money laundering http off guardian org why hong kong losing out mainland china ,1
get out ,1
especially too ,1
you would the same you were paranoid vicious dictator leading nation brainwashed worker bee with sense individualism ,1

you realise you more than capable avoiding the thread you don wish contribute then why have sub reddits all the reason sub reddits exist compartmentalize discussion amongst people with common interest topic any topic non basketball rocket nba and dominates the discussion then that take away from the purpose rocket exists begin with chance are there another sub reddit where news discussion those topic far more productive your comment seems mean these are uncomfortable truth you personally wish avoid like said wa opinion commented thread regarding this topic here over the last few day and discus this with friend certainly not avoiding this issue ,1
source the radicalization protester those sound like fringe opinion ,1
dude despite his smug attitude and sarcastic response the medium that everyone lap still liked him person and thought wa good representative for the nba this just extremely disappointing him ,1

boy http wikipedia org wiki yellow journalism political cartoon and meme have absolutely changed the course politics economics and human history whole understate the power http www amity edu gwalior jccc pdf jcc journal december pdf meme culture entirely foolish ,1
totally agree are super cold from why not take few mid range doesn make sense completely abandoned area the floor remember two year ago the jazz chris paul won that series taking mid range shot ,1
underestimate the power meme culture entirely foolish that probably the cringiest thing have ever read this sub imagine thinking that highly yourself and not having realistic grip the world and wa around when people suggested trading harden for ,1
generally consolidating talent the way vacuum however you are considering trading eric gordon and then this construct doesn make any sense would have too many substantial hole plug and eric beast both end especially the playoff lately still don trust butler enough for this trade with his history nagging injury etc and the chemistry issue definitely doe not want here had several opportunity team with his pal harden want his own trying prove himself and others that deserves the same consideration the tier star ,1
did you even read what linked power ,1
yep but that not what this situation all ,1
hell nah ,1
hasn even played game for miami yet lol ,1
these are thought well butler doesn bring enough replace tucker and imo ,1
this would destroy chemistry mean deliberately chose not compete have his own team ,1
lmao can tell what level this comment ,1
deadly the lob feared and now just throw the vicinity and still get onto the scoreboard then suck the defender towards him subsequent possession with the floater and clint open again counter counter counter the most complete offensive package ,1
let not forget harden apologised and the rocket team didn allow question about china let not forget that morey deleted his tweet apologised and since remained silent rather than standing let not forget fertitta immediately distanced morey from the rocket following the tweet morey ha shown himself coward too notice isn speaking the medium all soon there were consequence his tweet shut and backtracked real quick ,1
his dad wa coward too ,1
steve kerr fucking kike faggot wonder opportunist ,1
would love butler this team but that lot give however think it fair trade due everyone age but come down two position being filled more than adequate level one position being filled more than adequate level would more interested trade involving capela tucker for butler whiteside something along those line but heat would never that would have lopsided trade that favor the heat think whiteside would nice addition the rocket team ,1
think that the point bringing rus break down the defense they cant predictable and the defense cant set their strategy with rus you add infinite amount variable offensive opportunity that lead open bucket the offensive scheme doesnt even have change much you just let rus break them down tire them out over qtrs and make easier for the other player what they always done ,1
this unfair ,1
yao wa but buy ,1
think mean hong kong ,1
iove but gigem ,1

damn niece out again smh ,1
how the point work ,1
this particular league the scoring head head basically mean player get point for every positive thing done score rebound assist steal block loses point for turnover and think for missed shot you have roster player and each week you choose your play meaning you won get point from the guy your bench you play against one other fantasy team week and the team with the most point the end the week win the game ,1
can even deny ,1
hell ,1
also our school much better prestige and academic wise trash university ,1
roll tide ,1
hou sure you find paragraph particularly interesting not the only one baffled how ownership let the quality true contender decline effort avoid the tax ,1
didn say you couldn you stated that the isn involved with genocide muslim merely contradicted that iraq alone ha some estimate suffered over million civilian casualty and caused million refugee both internal and external you can good faith say that aren involved genocide when there active genocide level conflict yemen that are participating saudi american coalition air strike actively target civilian and civilian facility ,1
you miss point unless alternatively motivated few disagree that the nba fucked but this question doe not help the heart this question content sure the medium wa briefed not talking further about what answer are you looking for with that question it just cnn reaching cnn doe not care about sound like you care more about than cnn and would say good you for that and fox dont care about either you were thinking about making partisan ,1
some you rocket fan think rus just trying experiment long time rus and fan can tell you will jack ,1
have disagree rus mid range used automatic about two year ago still serviceable last season people overblow his inconsistent mid range hope brings back and scoring like gold ,1
for that matter not sure how much want there either ,1
rip ,1
lost why everyone finding him ,1
what guy know about our country and our government you know anything about our country beside western medium biased report fuck you nmsl cnmb ,1
harden did speak the issue love china and apologizes for his supporting the protest ,1
yep had settle for his red and considering ordering when available worst case scenario dhgate but given the current situation insert position ,1
doe step foot http streamable com imcdq ,1
the replay they showed the arena did not show the foot just the hand contact the entire place laughed heartily ,1
think the league trying learn from that event and make sure not repeat but this also ha difference nuance let see what happens going forward ,1
yeah because everyone really cared before the nba wa involved ,1
capela look kinda unnerving when shrunk down the other player height ,1
there something wrong with more people caring now just people didn care before they still shouldn care ,1

yao who never heard him ,1
when rus actually running play looking good really hoping the coaching staff can get his iso habit check especially right now hid iso game not working because not even close being game shape but ha everything need play off his teammate and should really focusing that anyway his jumper ha not been great and the shooter have seemed struggle find their rhythm after his pass however looking solid around the rim both scoring and finding clint under the basket also think set more screen the last two game than did all last season think this situation might really good for him but see how much bad isoball antoni let him get away with ,1

while have love for kerr have stated before guessing once morey tillman harden and the nba initial response turned sour for all side memo wa sent stfu and say nothing this point china maybe lost cause but the wrong quote the subject can burn not only what remains that bridge but others including opportunistic critic stateside doesn help but staying mum least won fan the flame higher the issue complicated and messy one from business standpoint you can just pull out the deal have that are work without blowback ,1
lmao this for real ,1
there nothing messy complicated about saying morey shouldn fired the commissioner already said much brad stevens had problem saying james harden had problem saying adam silver had problem saying steve kerr somehow doe this isn about choosing side relation this about daryl first amendment right not fired for stating his opinion ,1
there wa video yesterday the day before kerr saying medium not going comment because prefer speak issue well versed this not one them not exact quote but something among those line also mentioned that reached out his brother law chinese history professor order get more insight the issue ,1

honestly why the fuck care what steve kerr opinion this want know why dantoni think couldn give rat as about steve kerr ,1
well that very debatable position would bet kerr doesn feel that way china would just let everything coach asked them better required speak all issue where could maybe have positive impact guess should also speak about turkey and syria nike sweatshop the hypocrisy all having chinese product the situation venezuela and billion other bad thing free person who can have opinion and not have opinion exactly like not perfect but calling him fraud and coward way out line ,1
stfu and back the wasteland really just want back talking about basketball here for kerr and the rest the nba go don blame them for caring about issue close home and feeling apathy towards issue other country before all this did you even know about hong kong did you speak for hong kong against india for kashmir and for iiraq both which just experienced their own tiananmen square esque incidence did you speak and take action against duerte the philippine against spain for catalan when spain crushed their popular independence movement against france when they cracked down the yellow vest movement the way china cracking down hong kong the answer don lie you haven heard most them the incidence you vaguely heard about you didn care enough find out more the one you know about you didn care enough anything about because those are problem county far away that doesn affect and you not going start now you know what effect trump wanting like and trying turn into his personal china and that why the speak out about these issue the only reason you and your buddy supposedly care now because you mad kerr pop lebron ect cause they speak out against your dear leader often and this your way getting back them ,1

the nba involved now with that morey tweet either doesn know who morey doesn know anything about politics ,1
unpopular opinion people who aren politician shouldn obligated comment international political issue when there are billion dollar and building tension between the global superpower the line kerr can choose take stand whatever issue want the social medium era demanding that everybody have opinion and state that opinion everything all the time why have much uninformed bullshit flying around freedom speech mean freedom abstain well let him abstain peace the and world government can even figure out what the hell about china sure kerr ha opinion here but voicing gain practically nothing but may cost his colleague like klay with his anta contract million may cost the team work for hundred million valuation and may cost the league billion that lot other people money thinking about when the only real benefit condemning china appeasing the naive twitter mob who never had consider the consequence themselves and the people around them when they take principled stance and have never once had those principle tested the face something fraught the issue between china and the nba ,1
amen ,1

don think these two topic disagree with each other preventing further escalation like the chinese government doing isn the same escalation china doesn want the average individual american interested sport start paying attention the other hand these recent event show just how much stand gain lose the corporate and also individual level fairly certain lot people the nba are newly aware just how damaging their criticism china can for not just themselves but for other people involved with the league wouldn surprised people wanted just keep their head down going forward continue doing business ,1
the nba ha been involved with china for nearly decade tiananmen square wa and the uyghurs have been detained since not even gonna add tibet into the mix not mention ene kanter ha been getting death threat from erdo for year now and nobody ha said thing this fake activism finest ,1

little boy kerr ,1
seriously pretty rich trump supporter act like they give damn about moral issue ,1
how fuck with the ccp ,1
agree with you that people who aren politician shouldn expected comment international politics but wasn being asked about political issue china wa asked about think morey should fired for his tweet that very basic and simple question that doesn involve chinese politics and hong kong same go for the question asked harden and that reporter wa about feeling comfortable about voicing their opinion the future because the nba recent statement course nobody obliged address even these comment but you market yourself someone who outspoken for what right but then shy away from very basic question like that people not personally btw are gonna call you out are gonna call you out ,1
yes lol ,1
thanks for posting that list just threw nike the dumpster and canceled some upcoming flight united ,1
great rocket content right here ,1
they protesting excessive police violence and racial inequality those are really good thing fight against steve kerr ,1
think quite interesting that this conversation isn going further than the rocket nba right now there are myriad american company who are making the same human right profit trade off significantly greater degree going talk about let really talk about this isn nba thing ,1
god you dense you gave link holocaust survivor claiming that these detainment center are comparable nazi concentration center that literally appeal authority doesn matter one iota what they think what matter reasoned comparison between both situation here let compare them nazi concentration camp rounded and imprisoned against their will german citizen based ethnicity neither committed nor were involved any crime starved systematically murdered never released nor ever planned released the situation wa permanent until their death migrant detainment center choose cross the border ill knowing that they would detained while legal status wa sorted not citizen the united state america committed were involved crime virtue illegal border crossing well fed not murdered well treated situation temporary and they will released once legal status sorted either returned home nation allowed enter america but yeah totally the same thing ,1
need some kind place for this discussion here for long china chooses boycott the houston rocket ,1
whore and silver his pimp winnie the pooh the best john daddy don like when you sas talk the client ,1
the ,1
fraud ,1
who care getting real old everyone expecting player coach and gm political analyst after morey tweet like just because kerr any player belief one cause they have outspoken educated and put out public opinion every issue get that trash out here ,1
this about whatever kere say going get twisted wouldnt comment either ,1
water wet ,1
wait nene longer the rocket team ,1
sad that some internet rando can confidently believe that through google and critical thinking they know more about the trauma the holocaust than actual survivor testament the lack education could cite you source instance all those comparison between concentration camp actually happening but use clear you don read nor care for source gimmie bit try find podcast rich white dude new york can explain you then maybe you give shit because isn appealing authority ,1
yes rocket fan that doesn like kerr for stupid reason ,1
nike just removed all the rocket gear from there store ,1
you don really understand the point not asking that kerr analyst even support hong kong this about morey all require that people remain consistent with their own word kerr outwardly support protest and free speech spineless not support morey for exercising these exact liberty when kerr ha defended them every other opportunity nobody would give fuck alvin gentry refused answer the question this isn about what issue kerr support about him remaining consistent with those ideal that already doe ,1
reading rainbow massacre never forget ,1
the same vein that nobody should forced keep their mouth shut issue they care about nobody should forced into bad position speaking out like kerr harden rus and everyone else have been since morey tweet ridiculous and this sub need quit frothing the mouth over this shit ,1
and the company the nba the houston rocket have already stated very clearly morey not losing his job and the league ha stated they support his right free expression why can kerr simply say agrees with that what difficult ,1
fair technically not amendment right however fundamental value american and completely non political for kerr simply say morey shouldn fired but that too much for him apparently ,1
when there gigantic international incident that may reshape the league know would nice know that the nba family ha each other back when come thing basic being able freely state their opinion steve allows the league look fractured very fundamental part being american ,1
wa wondering about that yesterday hope anyone waiting order get them ,1
chinese version this http ytimg com tajyaringtg hqdefault jpg should the logo shirt for those that don know that the album cover for banned bad brain one the most respected punk hardcore band all time they also happened all black which made even harder book show the title refers them being pretty much universally banned from every venue their hometown washington you could that picture but with lightning striking zhongnanhai something instead ,1
agreed don think this sub should sounding board for discussion but think fair game when the issue overlap ,1
sure you cannot lump kerr with harden and rus though they just want play basketball and collect their cash there nothing wrong with that kerr however ha built his brand around being politically active now when could actually effect him silent doesn have answer just spineless not still respect harden and rus even though they don want comment not respect kerr for there difference ,1
love the winnie the pooh flair ,1
harden ha been playing peacemaker saying love china and the chinese fan where the outrage there kerr didn start this shit show morey did all people complain about shut and dribble and when kerr say not going sound byte people hypocritically lose their collective mind ,1
don want him fired but were not protected all meant same go for you and said something that could cost the company money etc ,1
the nba ha told everyone shut about and all the player and coach are listening their employer ,1
can wait till the season start sorry people are being detained and beaten but more concerned about the well being american and their family couldn care le about what going across the globe let the deal with ,1
jordan punched him the face for reason ,1
let assume speaks out then what will china stop but kerr will probably lose his job and never coach again china will then pull all funding and will affect thousand people employed the nba it not easy black and white situation know exactly where kerr stand stand person but not coward listening his employer and showing lot restraint despite the awkward position don get wrong what happening china horrible love see the nba cut tie completely but can see why adam silver taking the lead ,1
agreed ,1
rocket space amazing ,1
wow damn ,1
the only hypocrite here kerr politically active speak truth power type until the time come criticize actual authoritarian government putting muslim camp then doesn want get involved garbage person and now everyone know never heard harden talk politics ,1
you brave ,1
you chinese ,1
his and model are the exact same ,1
what harden playing peacekeeper chinese fan looking out for his money harden doesn say shit about politics that the difference between him and kerr look kerr right most the time speaks you never catch saying shut and dribble don bring that shit the problem that fails speak now fails speak when convenient spineless and weak ,1
kerr ha suffered for his political stance the past speaking from personal experience think folk are reading into the wrong way ,1
yessir gonna amazing once the chemistry with rus get better ,1
suffered received nearly universal praise from the medium ,1
never heard kerr talk about anything other than issue you don insert yourself into foreign politics but care about thing you garbage person got all are nut ,1
except opinion that your arguing isn opinion your dumbass think that support china because not bashing fertita for doing basic damage control because not making stuff about how betrayed morey threw him under the bus when literally all said wa morey doe not speak for the rocket his view are his own basic reading comprehension would help you know what word actually mean but you rather overreact and lie than worry about the truth ,1
kerr frequently speaks international issue and care for them great deal spent time growing lebanon and his father wa killed plo operative may need fact check that not solely interested nor vocal about matter either way saying morey shouldn fired for expressing his view american issue ,1
again basketball evolving you may not have noticed but team aren running two footer out there any more people also used say that team cant succeed with shooting analytics morey doesn care about what traditional sentiment say about how build basketball team hypothetically trade for this big how many minute you think get mda would still run man rotation and tucker would still play basically the whole game get minute le depending how much run shumpert the guard lineup again you think fertita cheapness caused morey not make trade for guy who would get potentially minute game the playoff and that what caused not win championship make total sense ,1
yeah want know how suffered ,1
you need add recent development china http www nytimes com business china blow whistle nationalist protest against the nba html and protester are being radicalized and getting absurd demand and parole like free which way revolutional and stupid they need demand what possible and what they did before police need held accountable democracy least for the next year under chinese rule then over and people need start think where move but that different topic there enough time for that ,1
either way not obligated speak any political issue period regardless whether not wa marching blm rally pride parade anything else and any statement will taken hard stance the news outlet and the reddit twitter outrage army stupid ,1
rus there much room for activity ,1
yeah real hard stance say agree with commissioner silver that should able express ourselves and morey should keep his job wow could you imagine the outrage stuck his neck out like that ,1
can the outrage culture already running wild this thread and didn say anything you don think taking any stance would have million idiot cry matter what said ,1
new hunched over hartenstein ,1
what china doing now doe not compare any that even propaganda setting ,1
what million idiot would come him for giving the quote just gave ,1
you soyboys loved steve kerr while the trump voter told you wa chump now look you ,1
morey hired mda not the other way around what mda think carry little weight unless straight say either morey him ,1
don care that some people aren speaking but those that speak loudly against potus and refuse speak this are showing they aren really honorable all just doing what cool ,1
and they don even come close proving point wrong either hence why brought thing back the point except regardles your refusal admit they absolutely prove your point wrong you can say fertita won into the luxary tax that costing bring back le when le only went into the tax twice and the issue wasn the lucary tax the repeater tax what are you talking about here you can pretend that you were talking about but when you spend the time complaining about shumpert and ennis how didn replace luc and ariza fertitta sign off all major move and know this from interview with him sign off still morey that scouting choosing negotiating with for all the player morey still control the franchise but you are blaming fertita for not replacing player your liking fertita just sings the check which despite what you want believe are far larger than they were when le owned the team again just fact want know you agree not although guess should ask you are you aware that paying the luxury tax last year would not have meant paying the repeater tax until possibly the season yes aware that why kept saying avoid and delay the repeater tax already over the cap now chance are paying this year use your line checker see how often they played for coming from the person who trying call shumpert suitable forward replacement this laughable ariza played his minute shumpert played his minute foward last year what laughable that you cant fathom calling shumpert anything but the position spend his minute but heaven forbid call our starting small foward for half decade small forward the most used lineup with mbah moute the floor paul harden luc tucker capella minute harden gordon luc tucker capella minute harden gordon luc tucker nene minute paul harden luc anderson capella minute harden gordon ariza luc capella minute harden ariza luc tucker nene minute harden gordon luc anderson capella minute harden ariza luc tucker capella minute paul gordon luc tucker nene minute harden gordon luc tucker anderson minute out one those lineup wa the for minute but since according you ariza wa you might argue that luc wa actually playing the that lineup too but sure laughable source just look the starting lineup from his first year pheonix how guy playing guard unbelievable you that you need source for that all thing morey brings him several option trade target that how go down than morey the one suggesting sign ennis whoever yet you give him the blame but it austin river fertita sign off you give morey the credit that the issue that the point not any the other paragraph bullshit you typed but again the point just clarify that turned ryan anderson contract into shumpert and nothing else and maybe should throw cost believe ended being first second two and melton right are you suggesting that liked that trade thought wa good idea because hated that trade the time and hated more when the sun were able get more for ryno than did but again the point this whole thing you give all the blame this fertita when morey the one actually negotiating the deal that just laughable ,1
rocket run the five out cheese offense ,1
because doesn want any part the controversy ,1
too late for that don you think guess only care about the right free expression when the one doing the expressing ,1
kerr brave smart wise man that once stood against fisticuffs trump coward also google search winnie the pooh taobao and you can buy many pooh toy and wearable from mainland taobao website your reddit turd western news wrong fake news ,1
rus probably amazed this okc wa surrounded mainly slasher ,1
many freedom fighter here seems funny that china ha been the same way for year and now suddenly people start care just because morey sent out simple little tweet that deleted soon after most people china are happy right now living normal life the only difference between normal person life china and western country some internet site are blocked and you can speak out against the government publicly those thing suck but not worth making such huge deal out once the younger generation china take over believe the government will change lot not anyone not from china worry about that let their country develop their own will say pathetic the way china reacted the tweet and make them look very weak like child chucking tantrum until they get what they want the situation dying down now and time let the focus the nba should basketball not politics ,1
just what always needed ,1
wolverine enemy now read article ,1
had proven playoff rotation guy starter river when traded for shump new forward someone jamychal green ability better get all the shumpert gerald and house minute and playing mpg ,1
steve kerr getting the podium and constantly meanwhile morey hiding under rock and letting other people bail him out morey the real coward walked his tweet back and then went into witness protection program ,1
are you going answer question continue evade note said that willing change forward taller since height and length the quality issue note not brought morey once nor have credited him with anything not sure why you are work for tilman what tilman want note tilman took over the team the season that why using the baseline comparison for what ha done what ha happened since then very relevant had the best team the league and ha systematically worsened through personnel decision but please going back comment few comment ago just indicate which the fact with number revision height accounted for you disagree with ,1
,1
there opportunity virtue signal crack dad joke kerr pop gonna quiet ,1
true guess already pretty spot ,1
risked everything ,1
yeah are the team that banned china our general manager stood against regime when not lot people would hope what did count for something ,1
love bev wish come back ,1
american cororate mentality always against freedom and sick long time rocket fan and will boycott the nba until thing change for freedom done with american tuning their back our value for money ,1
this reminded tyson chandler looked really good the time had couple night ago didn watch him much last season but heard lakers fan saying wa cooked assumed would the same for last year nen did not look that way all very active both end ,1
raise your hand your bogometer not pegged the idea the lig rather would sacrifice staffer rather than star the staffer say pipe down they small potato and can disavowed nice couple level deflection from the player the nba gonna throw few office ppl under the bus for doing what they told rather than risk player saying thing they can control ,1
never thought read about bad brain rocket ,1
sad see all the soyboy liberal turn their back steve kerr everything they are weak opportunistic american hater stick with your guy and look like the fool that you are liberal trump ,1
just thought would pretty cool shirt plus more people should listen bad brain ,1
sorry you sad ,1
haven evaded anything note your new definition power forward mean our starting power forward isn power forward note not sure why you are bringing him now not bringing him now actually you were the first one mention morey and his name ha been mentioned dozen time since then but thanks for confirming your lack reading comprehension note tilman took over the team the season that why using the baseline comparison for what ha done weird how you would use not replacing ryno luc and ariza your main complaint against him then considering that happened for the season then had the best team the league and ha systematically worsened through personnel decision based the decision you claim the example him systematically worsening the team ariza wa the decline losing him not big deal luc and cant stress this enough played game last year another big whoop and anderson averaged last year but you right not paying them combined million the reason didn win the title because luc setting the bench suit would have somehow made clint not forget how play basketball ariza being here would have kept healthy and all know ryno wa the missing piece beating the warrior note nene wa signed trade asset help match salary you understand there will salary coming back right going back comment few comment ago just indicate which the fact with number revision height accounted for don disagree with fact you just not stating fact let major minute filling pfs and replaced their minute with minimum contract signing and eventually not paying million not including the tax hit for combined isn being cheap common sense and again your acting like fertita forced morey into making those move when would hope for the sake the team that morey smart enough know that they are not worth nearly that much paul george and kawhi leonard don even make mil and they have slightly more production than and ,1
hope you right but lotta game between here and june dude ,1
brodie new best fren ,1
true that still have big hope for hart tho ,1
new forward someone jamychal green ability better get all the shumpert gerald and house minute and playing mpg first all it funny you think there wa someone better available that could afford put together package they would want absolutely not would not even come close let alone minute tucker would still play ish minute wouldn take gerald minute because gerald not would between him and manimal for minute the backup and faried didn get half that many mpg and there big difference between having footer and only one guy over find any successful team that ha ever run lineup that small you saying you don want tucker weird how you say fertita ruined the best team the league which ran but now team can successful with lineup that small ,1
still would rather have faried really fit with rus and james overall especially rus speed really match that sad that both side still cant work something out because one jobless and the other still will have issue the season progress the backup center spot especially clint get injured knock wood ,1
thanks wa shocked soyboys have conviction ,1
have boner seeing rus this scenario ,1
not getting his jersey retired ,1
for simple regular season minute filling yeah good enough but not playoff rotation guy atm after watching tyson pretty sure still could ,1
oof year tough the meantime applicable nothing prevent clemons from wearing lot judgment used retiring jersey these day ,1
did you guy retire tmac jersey ,1
nope ,1
work both way though tyson really ha been downer especially the last two season depending the defensive scheme overall and the right roll and finish ha the basket see how play the simple regular season minute however could very important it important get rus james clint and play le minute overall then the playoff theyll well rested but it also important maintain seeding hopefully thing like the interior defense overall finish around the basket and rebouding etc all shored the season progress ,1
what clearly saying either way answer soundbite criticized for fine him not answering ,1
fair that probably what tilman mandated ,1
that lob fake clint and clint doesn usually jump until masterful ,1
haven evaded anything then answer the question which the fact you take issue with note your new definition power forward mean our starting power forward isn power forward can you get past the label for minute already said fine with going height instead label note not sure why you are bringing him now not bringing him now actually you were the first one mention morey and his name ha been mentioned dozen time since then but thanks for confirming your lack reading comprehension you realize there written record that you can consult before saying something this wrong right check again you objectively wrong note tilman took over the team the season that why using the baseline comparison for what ha done weird how you would use not replacing ryno luc and ariza your main complaint against him then considering that happened for the season then this main complaint against him what you think trying say had the best team the league and ha systematically worsened through personnel decision based the decision you claim the example him systematically worsening the team ariza wa the decline losing him not big deal luc and cant stress this enough played game last year another big whoop and anderson averaged last year but you right not paying them combined million the reason didn win the title because luc setting the bench suit would have somehow made clint not forget how play basketball ariza being here would have kept healthy and all know ryno wa the missing piece beating the warrior that role big forward wa never properly replaced and yes fault that the reason had more problem have problem with letting those particular player have problem with not filling the role btw you should use number including regular season gauge the impact those guy not last year note nene wa signed trade asset help match salary you understand there will salary coming back right you understand that minimum salary guy don need salary matched right can with him the same thing did with melo and mcw last year send him and some cash off another team for heavily protected second rounder that will never receive order avoid him appearing our salary obligation going back comment few comment ago just indicate which the fact with number revision height accounted for don disagree with fact you just not stating fact then explain how they aren you did fine job with that regarding altered the fact talk about the player height instead let major minute filling pfs and replaced their minute with minimum contract signing and eventually not paying million not including the tax hit for combined isn being cheap common sense and again your acting like fertita forced morey into making those move when would hope for the sake the team that morey smart enough know that they are not worth nearly that much paul george and kawhi leonard don even make mil and they have slightly more production than and will emphasize again since you seem understand point that the issue wa not retaining those player the issue wa not using ryno contract the mle replace the role ,1
not mistaken the floater shot harden ha been working for couple year now ,1
mda fine with short rotation the playoff had proven guy harden gordon and river are all guard forward and clint center there wa plenty available minute for guy come and play mpg that guy were big forward would have been perfect fit allow him clint and fill all front court minute and would have amounted least mpg giving mda small guy who had previously played all his minute guard wa very very bad roster building decision ,1
the nba ha progressive domestic following and voicing progressive politics opinion only bolster their fan base this different and challenge the political stance almost entire fan base ,1
wouldn take lakers fan word for much tyson wa pretty solid for them but lakers fan will always use those type guy pile onto deflect blame from kobe lonzo bron whoever they standing the moment lol def think can give something and also will great mentor for clint also seems get along with james and rus pretty sure he compton boy like james ,1
actually the opposite the called protestors are harassing people vandalizing infrastructure and violently attacking people including innocent bystander with different political view government staff and police ,1
woke ,1
yes been working since the spur series couple year ago when they schemed give harden floater wasn his game yet worked doesn work anymore ,1
lol like see any you start get political your workplace totally fine with his non response ,1
cracked cant help ,1
yeah not that communist china any great shake but kind find all this nationalist finger wagging from american right now kind laughable way more than what these guy listed you look back our history not have much moral high ground stand they have muslim reeducation camp slaughtered between million innocent muslim since starting the war terror which wa started for absolutely bogus reason their military budget about ours just because they forcibly limit free speech with government action and structurally limit with minority disenfranchisement corporate medium distractionary news cycle sport echo chamber and outrage culture etc instead their overt corruption extend free speech interpretation legally let corporation buy all our politician again not saying that are equal communist china just saying that these mod have some degree point american criticizing anyone about human right and treatment muslim sort laughable ,1
james harden mastering both ,1
feel bad for these people ,1
wolf only trade him dump salary probably dieng roco the perfect player for the modern nba and available there will shortage suiters ,1
,1
that really sad ,1
healthy and back his normal self wouldn mind giving the pick top perimeter defender with great shot exactly what need wouldn give gordon though but everyone not named rus harden gordon capela should available ,1
shit they love the rocket and want support them they won have that opportunity anymore ,1
stay strong iko ,1
sleep schedule ,1
never been one these how many people how close you get the player ,1
what bizarro world thanks for the link can wait til usher skynet and the crazy just accelerates ,1
still got ,1
temporarily shedding shipley flair for good cause ,1
wow that heartbreaking shock ,1
everyone stand lose money ref included what way like sure that the ref won lose any money from what went down china they relatively cheap labor compared coach player owner and other high level team employee and their salary isn tied the salary cap there way the nba would tie their salary what the nba make whole general there way the rocket would lose because the game being fixed for multiple reason order make the rocket lose game you need fix said game which mean not just ref multiple ref the very least and because above already established that ref have absolutely motivation want fix game for any specific team out side them having money the other team that mean likely the motivation would have come from somewhere else would have someone like adam silver who both hypothetically could control ref some way and someone who lost something big due what went down with this whole china mess let say for the sake argument that even possible somewhat coordinate with bunch ref and effectively fix several game against the rocket probably isn but might well not even try argue that point definitely will hard fix these game without any evidence being left that easy find any whistleblower anyone suddenly noticing the officiating being unusually bad against the rocket fixing game against the rocket the regular season will have very little effect unless talking about close game least only like game that maybe knock them down from the seed the maybe but that seems like lot work doing and risking your career just for little effect and once you get past game the more chance people figure out pointed out above point and finally this final point wa kind implied the whole time with the past few point but still bear restating silver were get caught the very least loses his job dude ha only been commish for few year and doubt ha the capital with the owner survive such scandal especially happens after the china debacle all those reason are reason why wouldn happen but top that there are probably way someone like silver any person could get back morey and the rocket that are le risky but are just effective fix game yes but have only game have playoff game there obviously bigger chance for win loss against tough opponent even wa game the difference making out the series drug james harden before important game that le effective and while are making joke kidnapping killing rocket player too would accomplish the same goal but would le risky than conspiracy formed with ref fix bunch rocket game hell since ha issue with morey seems like going straight the source and offing morey would the best revenge ,1
damn kinglechi our heart out you and your family losing loved one the roughest thing ever through life bad that you never really recover from but please know that time doe fade enough allow you live life again for that person pray that you and your family find that peace soon ,1
will lose the player fire morey harden good friend with him their tenure with this team will end the same time ,1
harden working both leg evenly the male shown the off season have favored his strong side leg ,1
america standing with daryl morey not going fired for this and the league certainly not going seek retribution against the rocket anything tin foil come true think that helping them get the final would interesting ploy try force china back into the fold ,1
hope ,1
possible part the issue too that the wolf don necessarily need get rid cap room they aren even luxury tax land yet and doesn really make sense for them offload salary with the purpose getting under the cap because they won under enough anything interesting anyway dieng deal end after season meaning will expiring for next season making much easier deal away they wanted actually seems like the most likely way covington involved deal mean shed salary andrew wiggins salary involved looking making around millionish for the next year you realize this season obviously isn working with him and town doing mini rebuild and trying build somewhat competitive team before kat deal expires might solid play ,1

creativity personified ,1
south park address the difference the latest episode ,1
tweet http twitter com lbjamesharden status ,1
you are arguing lot point that are completely irrelevant seemingly just for the sake arguing just going point out the obvious fact again and you tell what you take issue with were very close winning most team would all those circumstance and try upgrade the roster however possible the mle and ryno contract were our only way upgrade the roster without moving core player trade but both would likely mean paying the luxury tax the final team the tax paying era have paid luxury tax and champion let major minute filling pfs and replaced their minute with minimum contract signing and eventually iman shumpert who had played guard virtually his entire career that point due least part being small league standard who wa the only player emerge from ryno contract after all the dealing wa done and not likely signed this season those fact where you disagree ,1
sorry hear this may rest peace ,1
lol can someone tell him read his own book honestly don give two fuck about this dude fan seems like attempting his best capitalize the opportunity have with absolutely elite once lifetime player harden score good businessman trying maximize profit score good patriot and decent human being sacrificing human right and democratic value score fuck that shit dude let take this from two perspective scenario young salesperson from poor background trying support family have big deal from china being worked that could elevate station life going let human right and democratic value get the way that probably not being honest sad but true scenario billionaire okay china tell fuck off should tell them fuck off think pretty clear the tilman ha tegridy ,1
well fortunately winning chip will offset those loss pretty easily ,1
aaha now see why wa turning down autograph last night glad not just dick ,1
china should known better than fuck with the rocket pound for pound the most annoying fan ,1

lebron had chance speak china during the game and passed then well ,1
,1
they cannot watch live anyway due the timezone difference they watch the same way are watching the rocket game europe not many change ,1
losing his talent aside there probably gonna lot bad well morey doesn keep his job the near future mean could potentially resign but that probably make people think didn willingly and possibly kick another firestorm ,1
house playing ,1
wa expecting the chinese market about the same the market half it value ,1
would have liked waive pond over bennet but would have been risky move longterm and morey trust short term more probably right ,1
but now representing the china basketball association ban all the corporation between rocket china how ironic ,1
think saw number somewhere saying the chinese are worth bill assuming correct then this brings out salary cap mill ,1
idk gonna make the full regular season roster but been fun having him back honestly not even sure why ,1
stand with morey ,1

same ,1
try refreshing otherwise not sure had refresh once before worked ,1
yeah but you are going encourage demar then rus might well take them from really good because the pointer worth hell from better than from but you still see take more midrange than not arguing rus should keep taking them high rate but you can completely eliminate shot type for star player just bueno ,1
okay cool ,1
wesbtrook and river should never paired together lmao ,1
damn stop hurting the rim man lol ,1
besides that that wa way off thought rus played well wish looked for his shot the rim more but his creating ha been good harden killing with his floater and the lob passing clint going have field day this year ,1
rus obviously thinking very hard this game and showing how out shape not loving the lineup mike putting out there with rus either feel obvious that tyson can run with rus and danuel isn good enough shooting right now not getting ,1
glad rus shedding off the shade his previous season the preseason okc fan have said though rus dgaf about preseason ,1
westbrook trying play rocket ball but want him play the way played okc driving the rim driving defender ,1
thank you ,1
gerald and danuel look terrible right now ,1
man capela ha been spoilt through out his career playing with duo with the like harden harden and jason terry pablo prigioni ,1
tyson chandler perfect fit for the rocket provides them quality backup center minute providing the same role capela off the bench glad don need watch hartenstein play ,1
lool ,1
house wtf man been complete trash ever since got paid ,1
mclemore bout take over his spot ,1
doe this cock sucking commentator not know that had paul not have gone down wouldve won the championship ,1
guy preseason complain house doing during the season ,1
seriously his defense used half decent and could hit his open shot ,1
hope westbrook just out shape right now look kinda rough right now ,1
rus can catch and shoot rus cannot dance and take also looking very heavy sit that man down ,1
gordon good ,1
look very out shape never seen him grip his knee this much this early game flummoxed ,1
anybody else noticing that nobody making when westbrook pass them ,1
westbrook look very out shape ,1
mvp sits another mvp come lol ,1
you think because hasn gotten used the rocket fast pace style play ,1
nobody this team know how rebound they just ball watching ,1
rus pull are atrocious but when get good screen his shot are good ,1
then who just passed donatello ,1
play slower than okc did when westbrook wa there think just out shape the moment ,1
come atleast the open look the team getting evident and good see ,1
yep the pass throwing aren like hardens gonna have get used the system ,1
thought wa weird that rus ran almost pick and roll wa mostly just isos which definitely not what rus should doing this stage his career ,1
mclemore lol ,1
what you exactly mean with that ,1
think rus need couple month recover from the knee surgery should probably back mvp level conditioning thanksgiving hopefully ,1
think antoni like what mclemore can provide the court next harden ,1
rocket need work their rebounding lot ball watching ,1
agree doing lot prodding and mucking the lane it rough way hoop don like and don like for ,1
think one the rocket analyst said twitter but basically meant the timing westbrook pass are off sloppy gonna have build chemistry ,1
brh ,1
fuck are going attempting three game this season ,1
why are giving lead like that ,1
hit one from before the mclemore assist ,1
aren going settle for man ,1
seems bit lazy hope this preseason talking ,1
doubt house will start the season what you think ,1
can tell this joke not lol answer think cuz had not just knee surgery but hand surgery this summer and can imagine had bunch time play basketball until probably few week ago ,1
think you guy will fine mean wa with the starter just the lineup and being out shape sucking these thing take time the past year didn hit our stride til december learning teammate and having chemistry take time ,1
offense and defense look off today ,1
can watch because australia and nbastreams dead how rus doing ,1
westbrook and river hopefully won pay much together during the season not enough spacing those lineup river should tied harden the minute rus sits would make sense far the most sense general take out westbrook and clint for river tyson and thabo house and then come back the quarter with lineup something line rus green house thabo clint ,1
look horrible ,1
rus look rusty lol ,1
still bit rusty although playing better than wa the first game ,1
three damn need reliable nba source ,1
you can find nba com for free rus looking rough right now ,1
adamsilverfanpage you want watch ,1
this commentator such hater lol ,1
yikes this raptor commentary ,1
you have one inv pls ,1
not fantastic very heavy leg making pass normally make with steven adam but clint ha clue what they need build that chemistry not splashing his three but think probably average this year ,1
anybody know what the announcer are laughing about ,1
gasol didn play the first game make their offense much harder defend ,1
harden missing all these free throw kinda concerning ,1
course the raptor know what take win you just need superstar diva use you for year and have klay and injured ,1
this game really hard watch our bench actual dogshit tyson chandler wayy too old should gotten legit centre backup montrez something fuck moi ,1
,1
ugh rus bad shot selection lmao ,1
you really shouldn putting that out into the open that how the fed end finding out about ,1
just woke few minute ago how wa the first half westbrook saw him turn over time about second ,1
sorta like how you guy used paul for two year and then threw him away when got injury prone and klay played quarter the final those the warrior won ,1
donut ,1
first min wa solid then wa utter trash bench couldnt score ball movement transition wa atrocious ,1
rus also notorious for playing trash the first half like take risk the second half will usually tighten see but everyone kinda look bad ,1
bruh raptor just won champ should celebrating not trying research fact defend winning championship lmfao ,1
got some season vibe with the defense using ,1
rocket are west coast team ,1
just response the announcer being snooty and trying compare kawhi reach fantastic level ,1
true everyone look gassed ,1
why nene look like about knock someone head off ,1
did harden fuck this dude wife ,1
obviously focused rus but not loving harden here either anyone going try anything else ,1
not looking good bad game watch lol ,1
preseason form usually carry onto start season fuuuuuuck ,1
harden trying create contact and did sir wa trying make lay but ,1
these commentator are really mad about harden ,1
this such strange game it like exhibition game all star game type feel neither team waiting for their teammate get down the court it just jitterbug attacking from each team ,1
entire team look like trash jacking blowing their defensive assignment best miss this game almost regret waking early watch ,1
beard forgot how shoot ft ,1
wa like this last season just kinda stand around and shoot ,1
you would think with the way this as clown carry and about him ,1
damn man stay strong take some time off love the work you but family first thought are with you from the rocket community ,1
what the hell happened your guy team jesus ,1
they are just feeling thing out and not taking this very seriously evidently ,1
not sure why many here are freaking out about pre season game the most experimental team the league going try some weird shit and feel thing out ,1
wa upset because lost his iso god power worked fine when wa harden level for isolation play that being said need change westbrook isn being correctly utilized the only way see this working moving harden off the ball when and westbrook are the game the same time harden better ball than westbrook but harden ha more off ball skill than westbrook doe harden need compromise for this work they playing right now the rocket are first round exit ,1
russel bestbrook ,1
missed ton three and the raptor have been capitalizing transition ,1
rus heating ,1
some sign life from rus close that quarter good see james had looked little tired off ,1
say that the celtic last year lol ,1
not off topic just that one agrees with you ,1
prime ,1
this the rus okc know and love ,1
sent ,1
hahahahaha classic heating little and then heat check because why not ,1
think mda encouraged rus shoot ,1
don think the pass think the pace that make guy miss wide open three with rus the floor ,1
mean preseason and just got cleared play yes shoot ,1
idk semi confident rus won look this bad during the season experimenter and take risk just trying find his rhythm and range ,1
now making huh ,1
lol these announcer complain about every call ,1
too ,1
from ,1
wait missed what happened gerald green ,1
that small bean compared forced sterilization uighur woman dude harvesting organ from vulnerable minority and political prisoner using your market size suppress free speech and undermine democracy global scale chinese new year just trash city jersey burn that shit ,1
think vinnie the poh shirt the way ,1
think might little bit cautious taking contact drive too since preseason seems like when doe drive rather creates open look for someone get the rim ,1
just another reason say fuck fertita ,1
you have some site for bro ,1
conventional wisdom would say not take three when you brick that many ,1
limped off court ,1
return the mac ,1
maybe couple mid rage shot wouldn hurt ,1
wtf happening cant watch the game ,1
man this suck seeing this feel bad for the true fan china who had their favorite team pulled away from them all rocket fan the end unfortunately politics keep dividing ,1
almost all owner are clown worry all club just think the poor net only the matter ,1
from both harden and this what wa hoping would done ,1
new logo with new uniform would offset that ,1
would agree def not ,1
win box score http www espn com nba boxscore gameid http www espn com nba boxscore gameid ,1
pretty rocket ending the last game won but wa ugly lost but looked good ,1
swag ,1
sportsurge discord and some the other site they always used definitely ha made harder ,1
like any the other free event they seating first come first serve usually pretty packed but not like game time packed show early because the line get will determine where you sit once you get inside ,1
sauce for discord please ,1
please don take three playoff game you only going make ,1
honest did not look ready for prime time tonight but wa still fun hell there ,1
still the best guard morey ha ever drafted ,1
for little problematic figure out rus fit this team can create and all the thing doe but his shooting doesn fit moreyball granted preseason game and working back into rhythm but rus what and just don know where that going fit mda and morey style ,1
still got find consistent rotation ,1
did just from one the most hated team the league one the most liked because one morey tweet lmao agreed fuck china ,1
god that number still haunt this day ,1
adamsilverfanpage not kidding work ,1
the fan don want rus taking the coach don want midrange guess supposed smol ben simmons then for sure being encouraged shoot ,1
and have figure out how work rus better general launched lot that should not have been taking imo also his passing not quite sync yet ,1
miss you ,1
bro it russell westbrook figure out people saying the same stuff about how need the ball his hand useful the court and they turnes out alright being one hamstring away from the final ,1
surprised not more well ,1
stop snitching ,1
glad you got but man doe that seem pricey for preseason game ,1
,1
well shit reddit will pounce any opportunity hate china and it people ,1
mda known for using big rotation the regular season general think westbrook harden gordon tucker capela house river sefolosha chandler and mclemore will the main rotation ,1
green will most likely instead mclemore ,1

morey told rus how increase his taking instead midrange jumper shooting his first two preseason game compared last season that all rather poor preseason showing should get least league average scoring with the rocket rocket beat writer have been talking about his timing being off because couldn play all during rehab his second game his pass were still somewhat inaccurate for his standard but still improvement from his first game offense will fine rebounding the other hand everyone ball watching and nobody even try box out the opponent big ,1
for sure rusty and playing your first few game another time zone after not playing full court for few month will lead rust think will his usual self couple game into the regular season ,1
bruh ,1
aren still paying matt maloney about that much ,1
really liked ben though ,1
thunder fan guy know firsthand what westbrook but you can just assume will figure out got some bad habit that just drive you crazy and they never change watched for year him and harden have chemistry and got shooter around him but the way play offense just doesn jive with what the rox ,1
stay flexing man lol ,1
you really like green the first time get hot ,1
think will work the beginning the season there will growing pain don forget dwade worked with lebron and wade couldn shoot save his life ,1
thought his obviously thats issue good with but two extra wasted possesions term passing got the guy lot open look they just missed open shot but think he still getting his leg under him hopefully get better ,1
theyre basically the same player altho trust green ability get hot more and the overall experience and knowing the other guy tendency more ,1
know wa preseason but when had the ball against defender and drove straight into ibaka got flustered got the foul call but that otherwise turnover waiting happen not used having our player that ,1
who will the starting for because house ha been hot garbage ,1
question wa with this many empty seat just looking through other highlight and look like other game have this many open well ,1
his penetration ability sell for fine with him shooting catch and shoot from harden someone else give him some space ,1
yet all partake self censorship not don not saying something rude for particular reason not the same self censorship you setting false equivalency not his job nor will ever his job make political commentary political discourse the job every american citizen anyone that actually paid political commentator chiefly concerned with making money and beholden their corporate master not actually expressing themselves freely maybe speaks for you you completely missing the point this censorship set dangerous precedent and ha wider reach than just the nba look the recent debacle blizzard hollywood stifling creativity and censoring others ourselves appease tyrannical dictatorship inherently american and spit the face our forefather that fought risk being hung traitor for freedom from oppression ,1
gordon house backup atm ,1
chris clemons exciting hell all ,1
gordon according mda ,1
take special kind fool compare temporary detainment center for those that illegally and voluntarily cross our southern border order determine they can enter sent back the concentration camp used round and systematically murder targeted ethnic group german citizen ,1
wife work non profit that deal directly with central american refugee resettlement she ha visited these long term holding area known concentration camp along the border firsthand she found that most these camp are just apartment where the kid are attending school have access within their dwelling that have common area with playstations and big screen they watch movie the non profit around there arrange take the kid park the zoo museum etc not all are like this but the majority are what you speaking concentration camp are the ice detainment facility which legally the government can only hold them for hour not sure qualifies concentration camp they kick them out after couple day ,1
hope you live japan cause that price absurd ,1
the only slavery going here where the politician are importing dirt cheap labor increase their bottom line and then threaten take away their sponsorship have them deported they speak that indentured servitude it core and the left support much the right doe supporting hong kong supporting people who are begging for democracy and ideal individual liberty against extremely oppressive government ,1
see that they this play when rus hand off someone and then that someone hand off him again front him and stay there block the defender think they are trying get rus shoot uncontested seems better ,1
guess holocaust survivor ruth bloch special kind fool while grond the expert what constitutes concentration camp lmao ,1
sorry say but westbrook should never shooting three until prof he improved ,1
the preseason lol the time chunk shot and try catch rhythm attacking more when actually count and plus this just his game back from off season surgery why risk ,1
people love james harden ,1
this thing that have worried about for year his point usage take game sure but any more than that and can become hindrance such explosive player and once his passing team chemistry get better hopefully won find the need keep taking much maybe working with harden can help him with rooting for you all this season ,1
done closer for cheaper ,1
love ,1
dank ,1
glad hear really been the bright spot this preseason ,1
and the seat are just decent ,1
people are overreacting pre season game lol ,1
rus with bad game imo he rusty big but stil made pt would need very good game make that rus gonna avg least pt ppg let rus ,1
rus and the beardious tokyo dank ,1

nowhere close how much you paid for preseason game probably like ,1
suck that don have competent starting really want gordon come off the bench and play along westbrook get some offense going when harden resting guessing mda will resting gordon early the ,1
lowering the salary cap wa morey plan all along ,1
didn sit with rus tonight but wa off before harden iirc ,1
agreed very possible scenario any sign morey the arena seems laying super low understandably ,1
yeah sign him anywhere even guy that work with the team haven seen him recently ,1
lol brave compared still since shortly after the ipo share been dead money but for the long run unfortunately kind forgot about until you just mentioned ,1
chris paul wa one the premier mid range shooter the nba and turned him into spot shooter that take the mid range shot nothing else falling think that probably what hoping for with ,1
that mean lot money but wa expecting much more ,1
been big winner for paid the mid from strictly dollar perspective think still great stock but don feel right directly contributing the bullshit seen this week couldn just hand wave all the crap china get away with anymore and there not much difference between baba and the government there always another way make buck ,1
dang hope alright can only imagine that even though publicly being supported that behind the scene there lot resentment and pressure him even though none can come out and say without being ridiculed that bucket people glad you made and got some your houston rocket fix while living out there ,1
wa right across the arena from you could you hear mvp chant ,1
offense unreal ain even clicking yet but you can see going even more exciting this year shot like dog shit from but remained neck and neck with the rap rus looking pretty good from what can see already erased the mid range from his game which really impressive considering how much ha relied and only his game look smooth from the line too get that back career average his get very nice boost still very concerned about the defense did better job not getting caught double leaving wide open dunker but still gave way too many open have real trouble once play start breaking down scramble and improv hopefully time with consistent rotation and guy learning their spot better this won carry but look like our biggest weakness right now very happy with the roster depth haven looked what our wa minute but about ready slam the over ,1
rocket japan ,1
sending love rip ,1
have idea wa just fucking around ,1

they not gonna get caught speaking something that could get them trouble misquoted ,1
why quantity blank ,1
played key role expanding the fan base not only the team but the entire nba china drafting yao very ironic that are now ground zero for that backlash ,1
they just gonna shut and dribble just too much hypocrisy man this league full shit ,1
yessir nothing better purpose driven life ,1
they are just men the league need something not the player only player than can steer this ship lebron ,1
harden already spoke this clearly stated support silver player exec expression and free speech don like reporter getting shut down but james ha said all need say ,1
why you use market order smh ,1
because position size none all business ,1
why that lady trying get james murdered ,1
because idgaf about penny this way that wanted out not sitting figure position plus trade killed commission this week the order wa cheaper than usually pay ,1
wa harden wa ,1
fair always get screwed with market order stopped using them ,1
seriously yao need protect himself and his family first ,1
lakers fan ,1
yeah with you percent people our subreddit are letting everyone off the hook expected but disappointing excitement for the upcoming season ha been greatly diminished the last week ,1
right check that shit out though cool ,1
really not hypocritical all these dude don know shit about what going over there why would they say anything speaking about domestic issue that they have experience with totally different situation than ignorantly commenting world affair chill out man not the job nba player fix china ,1
baba high volume wasn worried plus wa selling for different reason than normally just needed rip the band aid off and done with ,1
don naive yes with the nba and rocket organization part their response ha been greed motivated but harden already made statement qnd the larger power take care and protect the individual risk right now handled poorly enough the stuff going with medium right now could start war people life are very likely the line depending how comment might misconstrued might seem stupid but unfortunately right now where history can funny like that though can blame player for not saying something saying something both action make lot sense but especially for rocket player right now understandable ,1
thanks ,1
china also invested lot yao make sure wa success because they wanted make stride the international stage athletics owes lot his success them well and can understand how tough spot because national hero him publicly supporting the rocket would essentially him turning his back his country billion plus people ,1
harden still getting flamed for trying play peacemaker between morey and the chinese mainland positive after his quote went viral the nba put clamp down every player coach and executive that thing don get worse hope salvaging their rep either with china critic critic the outside ,1

you misunderstand the first part chinese gov focus fight but you focus freedom fact china daily and chinese gov also believe racist comment are wrong and freedom right the fight hurt chinese but not the freedom hurt chinese actually many chinese support hkers have what they pursue the beginning the movement but after seeing how they fight for freedom more disgust than support this time the nba would ban racist comment which hurt american lot but support the hker behavior hurt chinese lot that the double standard the freedom expression should not work the field that hurt you but can work the field that hurt chinese ,1

cool but never said anything about freedom expression not discussing the issue with that course there issue with freedom expression china doubt every one about the same magnitude intelligence wa the case communication would have been way easier but that beside the point only because can read each others mind should try our best communicate with others meaningful way not disallowing anyone freedom speech but judging whether this person action were productive his goal assuming that his goal wa highlight the problem with freedom speech banning houston rocket with his action only managed aggravate his fellow countryman and nobody cared about his message the result suggest that burning flag attempting burn flag not the most useful thing when you are trying protest china not only china but anywhere globe imagine what doe accomplish you may dislike nationalist but people generally have strong affiliation with their homeland don think there anything wrong with when you are insulting people you don really get your message across wa not critique but rather provocative act never said should jail not discussing that issue because that bullshit law and everybody agrees ,1
while the official flag pretty sure this not true representation the spirit hong kong the regional flag carry design five bauhinia petal each with star the middle red background the red flag represents the motherland and the bauhinia represents hong kong the design implies that hong kong inalienable part china and prospers the embrace the motherland the five star the flower symbolise the fact that all hong kong compatriot love their motherland while the red and white colour embody the principle one country two system ,1

vote for harden morey short ,1
ohhh probably should have dug little deeper before commented thanks man ,1
lmao moroney pretty clever though give you that ,1
easy raise enough money for the physical shirt the problem going logistics term handing them out and getting people wear them toyota staple center might not let you pas them out arena property and you have have volunteer employee handing them out somewhere where people can actually get them and then you have get significant number actual fan who have probably barely been paying attention the controversy wear the thing ideally you get enough people wear them that the camera have choice but show them support the idea but raising money not the hard part ,1
japan china ,1

before anyone get any idea have always been against reddit being used money making platform the mod not profit from anything here and cannot let user the same for the same reason this reddit policy using sub for profit strictly once profit becomes the motivation intent longer organic every time something like this come turn into money making shtick for someone get spammed here fairly constant with shit vendor and the like support freedom however can but this capitalist free zone gofundme linking your shirt idea etc ,1
censorship ha place the funny you mention that because the franchise sub you are commenting based state where illegal criticize israel ,1

free speech guarantee are for public and government setting not private business but it private business playing arena paid with public money it grey area the same issue with state run school they are technically private institution that can deny anyone from speaking they wish but they also essentially subsidized with government public money you right that there legal precedent but this may change ,1
firstly and most importantly holy shit dude fucking meme you sound like old boomer who can understand modern joke secondly even these statement were absolutely true you think that ha anything whatsoever with daryl morey basketball good part think this might troll not gonna take this any further because probably already fallen for the trap enough ,1
more people aren aware the entire china situation they can place context what mean there are already high tension between china and the because trade war china ha already successfully induced our president and government remain quiet because want come trade deal since morey publicly criticized them for issue that the united state already agreed not seems china may responding manner consistent with any one breaking that agreement concession remain quiet http www google com amp amp cnn com cnn politics trump hong kong protest index html ,1

see thanks for the clarification ,1
bother ,1
nothing more than shirt bit different story easy mind your own business and carry that the entirety lot different oversized sign banner and chanting yelling and such for legal standing don know what the specific are but bet heavily that the arena ha every right give you the boot they feel you are dressed inappropriately and they get decide what inappropriate hell heard plenty story about people sitting courtside being asked remove hat change shirt when they have gear from the visiting team ,1
aahhhh yes basketball back ,1
this actually really upsetting look their favorite team being ripped away from them the game being censored basically kinda fucked ,1
best mod the league ,1
the fuck china train full speed rocket but there are million chinese fan that just want watch basketball and probably don give shit about what morey tweeted ,1
steven take wa pathetic and most everyone outside china blasting him and espn for their garbage pandering you don have have identical political philosophy when you become business partner that ridiculous all should keep your money tbh nba wa great before and after china entered the fold don disagree that american are privileged but ironic you would say that given the position you are taking lol ,1
gotta feel bad for the chinese who are fan the rocket but have now pretend like they hate them ,1
fuck the mavs chinese government ,1
literally anything ,1
silver said the nba did not expect cctv cancel plan air the lakers net game but those are the consequence adhering our value still feel very very important adhere those value silver said that seems like response that show integrity how this despicable ,1

not sure the china eff the rocket train that deep where anyone even say the word james harden clutch the bear immediately china police surround them and take them prison maybe ha correct wrong suppose seems like all that ha happened their game aren the chinese broadcast and they are removing art and banner and stuff with rocket memorabilia would think would too much work the level where you wear anything with rocket logo just talk about the rocket public area they can put you jail for that although suppose nothing would surprise about china this point ,1
not fan just don think ha enough wealth really let morey his thing despite his uncanny ability still make work ,1
awesome ,1
covington ha year left his deal and only million not sure why the wolf would want move from him unless wa like really good deal and not like taking him off the team help them tank basically just high level role player just saw how much trevor ariza helped phoenix win those guy typically don move the needle term win and from houston side wouldn want offer anything really good because spot where could get similarly talented guy although probably more expensive deal from team trying get below the cap and shed talent that they can tank ,1
from medina way ,1
thanks china ,1
man fuck china redacted side ,1
lol harden more for sure deal with all the same backlash while putting just much effort into his game would the same because they probably two the most hated the medium but rus had his medium darling season harden deserves all the glory because they simply don wanna give him ,1

with you ,1
wa the lil cold front ,1
thank you sir safe ,1
yes agree that understanding the distinction between cultural and governmental authoritarianism important this mess however how fair really say that their culture that propels their government and not the other way around the end their government that armed and choses what they can cannot see and what they are allowed speak key factor authoritarian society including the third reich and the soviet union are using pre existing cultural structure form nationalistic attitude excuse their own censorship and mass murder the people their border these extreme action turn end benefitting those who turn blind eye and attach themselves the system the most that regard think you are giving china authoritarian aspect too much credit for what realistically original reboot taking place the century any case excusing attrocities commited defenseless innocent stuck within country the modern day reprehensible not worth considering the cultural root are entertwined with society like that because those root were always meant mean end and are most likely hollow already ,1
hope see you there mon alarm ,1
dmorey ,1

business business hong kong doesn even watch lot basketball all about football soccer there forfeit larger market for market gain horrible move can preach about support personally but publically tweet will definitely negatively affect the team and nba whole the china market the timing very bad too since pre season where consumer are deciding continuing their subscription not get fired don think any team will hire him the short run team can afford not selling the lucrative china market ,1
stand with dmorey http www reddit com dmorey stand with ,1
free morey ,1
think that the two situation were even remotely the same you have similar energy the but the isn suffering from anything close this ,1
cause free country right now ,1
ennius here wasn ennis philly take away the horrible start the team and looking what wa after coming back from injury wa every bit good houston wa philly but that being said yeah could have used him and temple net negative player way trust that the savior this team jamychal green would have been nice but dude ain pushing the needle think just disagree where were last season obviously green the player referencing being helpful look what shumpert green and house did their time the court point board assist steal block turnover minute essentially per game minute per game that pathetic think green would have made the difference possession per game enough win game and from stat line that horrible ,1
sad that spur fan had come this sub and give you your only gold stand with you bro ,1
astonished that one could ignorant yes know what talking about wife asian already said generally disagree with censorship other instance are numerous you really want play virtue signaling olympics read history chomsky manufacturing consent sure the native american and the european were best friend realize that tillman morey bos and can fire him want hope not and that chinese consumer and company can choose whether not they want sponsor the rocket you smart maybe you would position influence actually change thing rather than virtue signal but seems like you just want repeatedly state how smart you think you are the internet cya ,1
and american interest the region and freedom and the founder and your moral and literally the right fucking thing fuck china ,1
yea our concentration camp disenfranchisement and state sanction killing are completely different because want them cause easier sleep ,1
the chairman the cba willing wager bet what think ,1
but le screwed over than when they were being starved death the million progress right ,1
odd some people follow favorite team even player might wisest follow sport who you follow and support ,1
concentration camp people losing the right vote for reason you talking about current day usa don mean jerk honestly but seems like you just throwing around buzzword hoping something stick think you may acting slightly dramatic actually quite offensive and self centred compare the situation between the two nation again not trying rude but ,1
not sure they deserve praise for not sending him the gulag ,1
yeah idk about that holocaust comparison lol ,1
concentration camp the border wide spread disenfranchisement black voter north carolina for example but there are case all over the south you look outside yourself you find multitude problem that relate broader struggle worldwide people against abusive state ,1
stand with morey ,1
need post anything like this you get downvoted angry american fan ,1
ted cruz too lol who would think would the rocket bringing together the two party ,1
took out ,1
don give fuck about downvotes wanted show support for the whose position wa quite reasonable surprise that american fan have historical context and seem have absurd blind faith what they hear from fox cnn and msnbc and assume they informed rather than disinformed ,1
ummm hong kong wa colony before handed back china ,1
this pretty much throwaway season for the warrior fuck sure but only morey doesn get fired ,1
didn use his name because nobody know who kid random lmao ,1
you keep bringing the past acknowledged the struggle that have endured and continue endure happen agree with chomsky have seen him speak twice when wa working master degree what about thing disagree with vote protest volunteer donate time and money for the issue hand bringing right now and the suppression liberty that this thread about ironically you stated that chinese citizen are free what they want when fact they are not happen enamored with chinese history however equally appalled it recent history would also like point out that didn realize wa dealing with passive aggressive internet dolt who resort whatever that lower case upper case asininity garbage once they realize they the deep end the pool without their floaties ,1
yep looked into handful them through instagram and they have like follower follows ,1
fuck china and yao turn his team ,1
hmm you know doesn have much room operate there right just throwing that out there ,1
you would murdered the street you wore rocket jersey lol ,1
these are two completely different thing talking about here ,1
net fan speaking don claim this dude please know that all net fan are morey corner honestly more infuriated about this statement than most other people the moment ,1

real leadership from harden didn have this morey certainly should have sucked and bent the knee instead imo see ha any effect other news breaking mchale beside himself ,1
what doe say ,1
right now should honestly leave him out this atleast until get more information ,1
imagine your government watching protestors flying your flag and not screaming support for them this isn exactly chi minh quoting thomas ,1
and yet you can comfortably make all these criticism without one iota worry that anything will happen you for them meanwhile someone china criticized the country response fucking tweet nba and wa arrested http www reddit com nba comment deb chinese rocket fan arrested liaoyuan police yes there are problem america but acting like there room criticize because bad bad come off you the one who need look outside yourself ,1

not literally the entire conference you say minus team you can the seed with losing record the east making the playoff doesn mean being good team over there can both the owner job make sure they put competitive product the floor and tanking aka the opposite being competitive good job also you gonna list team that are bad now and the future you can leave off half the team that tanked last year not one year process how can you say the sun are good position for the future whether because incompetence not irrelevant the fact that you think the commissioner can kick owner out the league for not least making earnest attempt put together good competitive team team decade with out even sniffing the playoff and you think silver would kick out tilman when the team ha far least been title contender his time owner note not giving him credit for that also pointless now because they shot down the report that morey job wa ever danger reddit overreacted what shock but firing morey doesn mean the team throwing the towel there are other good gm out there ,1

fellow hongkonger morey hero both term shaping the rocket team and his personal empathy and understanding towards global matter well done probably the only time rocket are not receiving hate from other team seen nba ,1
say goodbye clint and gone the trade anyways and the last one being easy move positive asset and ducking the tax would have been problem ,1
louder than cuban now fortunately not quite bad cube wa when first entered the league though ,1
not paying more than the minimum replace the rotation forward lost ariza luc and ryno what make him cheap ,1
harden just ruined with his whole love china bit morey wa real one too bad everyone else didn have his back ,1

when signing trade doesn work out tilmans fault but ennis shumpert who didn make the minimum the way had turned out good addition something tell you wouldn have given him any the credit ,1
wa arrested for burn their flag ,1
decided hero for hour rather than slave for the whole life ,1

let not make simplistic pillaged the last chinese dynasty along with one their prize then socially conditioned them for year before finally letting them doubt the wa nice any sense when the takeover happened this among other thing can help explain the feeling china ha towards not trying say what china doing right now right but wish people are able more research the subject matter ,1
democracy wont weakened one singular action will many tiny one like world class sport club actively supporting country that fundamentally opposed free speech choice personally will boycotting watching houston rocket game buying nba merch support daryl morey ,1
fuck the founder ,1
imagine the team wa china right now instead japan lol ,1
they aren people nba are roasting the fuck out harden right now the lesson learned from this corporation are only progressive and for social justice when doesn hurt their pocket the nba the rocket and james harden who sponsored adidas who take him china trip every summer don want lose money suck but what make respect guy like kaepernick that much more willingly sacrificed his playing career stand for what believed ,1
seen some people talking about how le wouldn have done this lmao le would have assassinated daryl morey himself ,1
hopefully both have long playoff run just hope the rocket and nba what right ,1
yes the harden bit sad really wish some player not necessarily rocket player come out and stand with morey supporting fight for justice freedom and democracy not wrong thing the other hand sucking totalitarian state tyranny most certainly ,1
funny the same reasoning china us the same reasoning people here are using you not with you against smh ,1
that not cool dude bussiness and cooperation which based the respect each others history and feeling ,1
someone who uninformed there anything can read watch ,1
not james harden millionaire ,1
guess you saw harden statement james harden apologizes controversy grows love china http www espn com nba story james harden houston rocket apologizes rift grows love china ,1
tilman forced morey accept the sun offer for ryno would hope morey didn need anyone tell him that old ariza wasn worth mil not going into the repeater tax over player that wouldn have realistically raised our ceiling not the end the world despite what this sub want believe again chriss melo had succeeded here you wouldn thanking morey don blame fertita when doesn work out shumpert played his minute and last year the way ,1
nba not rocket ,1
also for replacing the fowards say faried wa pretty good wa minimum signing ,1
most likely the statement prepared someone with the rocket adidas however james harden the one that responsible for releasing ,1
you are then you absolutely retarded young and brainwashed your parent and going through your conspiracy phase where the government the boogeyman behind everything that can easily explained project much there little homie ,1
fair neither american chinese did say anything not true sure still love the chinese just sure still love american and compared them least china mainly fuck over their own people not saying love the government there reason best not too mix sport and international politics too much ,1
wa tell how fared the playoff pretty sure ennis had much better postseason wa the better vet min guy for our playoff rotation but better yet would have been paying for real rotation level forward replace ariza luc role ,1
thats wrong actually disposable income general laughable compared what the actual american can spend houston make money licensing fee advertisement revenue and direct purchase sale merchandise china fraction the amount they would make the boycotted houston for firing morey which would happen imo they were dumb enough this ,1
spending time forward role doesn make him grow become better rebounder traded for him because his contract allowed barely duck the tax could have had jamychal green for the same cost real forward who widely accepted significantly better player than iman but tilman preferred duck the tax and pray that shumpert would somehow become forward just putting him that role ,1
can least say fuck winnie the pooh ,1
let pander vietnam instead have lot more vietnamese folk here than chinese ,1
welp you can count out harden http www hongkongfp com love china nba star james harden apologises manager tweet supporting hong kong protest ,1
stupid one ,1
love see this too but think lot them won risk given they stand make bank from the chinese market think the only way for them not singled out all the majority player all speak together otherwise they just individually targeted ,1
til doing socially unacceptable thing and then asking police come get you will lead your arrest hope wa worth ,1
the only apology that would satisfy the chinese went hong kong and shot protester ,1
they have been china team since ,1
tilman can fuck himself honestly too concerned about the money that come from china and doesn care about anything else ,1
you want hurt him boycott his restaurant casino and hotel ,1
guess all took get the player shut and dribble wa money ,1
love china taipei beautiful ,1
what for all are crazy for thinking that doubling down the right answer not the best thing make this blow over asap order take power away from the vocal chinats take the the literally unwinnable little battle and back the long game indoctrinating the country through soft power globalization can change the culture you banned from the country ,1
harden not thicc enough ,1
mda using small bench isn faried fault ennis wouldn have got the same amount minute did the playoff wa here and shumpert put basically the same number here and shump got fewer minute the playoff than ennis gordon took the starting role fertita payed him and wa way better than both ariza and luc who only played game last year keeping him wouldn have helped all last year the playoff ariza playoff ,1
feel bad for all these people who have been blinded propaganda and conscription really grateful live democratic country where won get killed monitored constantly for thought ,1
come man ,1
not just with harden inclusion the episode but literally the whole episode wa about american selling out their freedom for chinese money almost like they went into time machine week ahead ,1
morey doesn even stand with himself anymore cowardly organization ,1
not like shumpert had never played foward before last year dantoni decision play small guard lineup unless your also blaming tilman for lineup minute decision you don like too now you realize tried trade for green too memphis backed out how that fertitas fault getting shump over green for tax reason wa important fertita that mandated interfered with basketball operation the level your implying than morey would have never bothered talking memphis the first place ,1
ennis wa better rebounder than shumpert just like ariza wa better rebounder than gordon btw not like gordon didn also play the playoff you should compare ariza minute the guy that actually replaced him shumpert doesn look rosy huh ,1
maybe but the end the day can say trump look like cheeto but they can say look like winnie the pooh ,1
what would trump ,1
sixer the final let this fucked stand strong ,1
mda wa forced play guard didn have forward the roster tried get green for the price first take knight for next year memphis found better deal nothing could have offered them that same deal only for about cheaper difference between bradley and shumpert expirings but chose duck instead because the thought shumpert could handle forward role couldn while allowing them get under the tax they could the second mistake isn requirement then the first mistake never get made ,1
trump isn doing anything that where everyone attention should focused not expecting sport league his job for him ,1
wa joke but bet will say something too much partisan support this for him not want the chance win vote from people the middle ,1
disappointed harden guess decided shut and dribble not everyone can jim brown kareem kaepernick guess ,1
ugh this give sick feeling feel like wa told this from above like statement that say don take away our money ,1
that not what meant meant the headline make sound more sensational ,1
very disappointed the nba both the player and the organization ,1
holy crap ,1
anyone ever believe harden wa the type engaged political discussion spend lot time reading thinking about this stuff the team should kept the player out this there good comment for them make ,1
the rocket fan over there aren coming out support defend james harden for this one either harden the wrong here ,1

where lebron and the other vocal player now sure hate trump and skip white house visit since it popular but why are they quiet when true oppression happening it because they want make more money selling shoe over there sad that politics and basketball are intertwined but that door open now don let the ccp control the rocket and the nba ,1
yao opinion want his family and himself remain free and good health going keep his mouth shut should respect that because this shit realer for him than any the rocket org literally risking his and his family life step out line ,1

morey about enlist his mit brainchild and think tank build end game bot lol ,1
can possibly imagine why you are getting downvoted for saying russell westbrook doesn play defense have you people not been watching basketball the last decade what this shit ,1
this might the stupidest shit ever heard spewed sport subreddit thought wa the biggest westbrook stan but you sir are denial ,1
nba ha lot business deal with china and ha scheduled decent amount preseason game over there not gonna put word his mouth but there good chance silver won cool with morey tweet ,1
definitely there will that talk interestingly this could some weird catalyst via sport for others take notice what going like tune out until involves one your favorite sport personality ,1

cba just cut all tie ,1
after the all star break shot percent new rocket fan because rus still not sure about the rocket system but would decent yeah ,1
they are insane ,1
brainwashed mainlander ,1
what doe this mean going forward like tillman gonna lose lot revenue something ,1
league average which pretty good considering isn the best shooter but you couple that with the optimism that will return good free throw percentage then massively improves the team and his own offense the shot improvement will stop team just sagging off him and daring him shoot which turn will allow him get better look the rim easier create opportunity for the rest the team and the free throw improves his willingness get the freethrow line will also improve again resulting easy point for the team ,1
fucking love austin river ,1
clean ,1
watch yao get directed the government force the rocket unretire his jersey lmao ,1
literally shaved billion dollar off the rocket net worth lmao all the team the nba had the rocket who piss china off lmao ,1
rocket are probably worth about billion dollar le long moreys around ,1
they are simply hilariously pathetic ,1
because that how work matter who you are you don shout china the best they hate you have plenty such experience here hong kong ,1
morey forced out there would riot all this doe make china look like heavy handed dictator ,1
billion prove ,1
and you think they care about public opinion ,1
never forget china need more than need them ,1
dunk man good historic man bad ,1
that really goddamn cool ,1
love rus and love the thunder ,1
that tweet exchanging word with the screen say the main player from team the west then the name the team and their player rocket not included just don understand why denying when himself tweeted first lol ,1
might lose bit revenue from china but gain the respect the civilised world benefit outweight the loss ,1
tell that tilman ,1
eli what did morey rocket for this happen ,1
reddick deserved for those racist remark ,1
lol got blocked for directly translating the word the screen captured him classic chinese cyber gang tactic whenever they face people with different view ,1
morey put out tweet that supported hong kong and china got mad ,1
someone showed this wouldn ,1
lostredditors ,1
always liked him person only joined the hate wagon due the mvp race now that our team all hate can set aside for championship only thing seperating rus and harden from being considered great championship see how play the rocket system during the regular season and that when have firm opinion him far everything look positive far seems like enjoying houston getting along with teammate and adjusting his game and working hard all the practice video seen him ,1
really wouldn mind the okc squad reunion during the last few year their career bittersweet having those legend starting and ending together ashame the biggest what will forever associated with that squad after the harden trade but would truly end era after they retire ,1
agree with fuqs almost seems like defender will try jump harden while doe this and his position whilst performing this move look like lead many awkward landing really don think harden going perform this move frequently though but see ,1
and mvp dpoy and fmvp ,1
inject this vein ,1
austin and rus pairing buddy probably timeline didn know wanted ,1
where are you getting this billion dollar figure ,1
the screenshot list golden state lac lal nugget trailblazer jazz thunder lol mavs and spur main team the west rocket didn make that list either the editor know crap all about the nba been left out specifically ,1
china not worth billion the rocket ,1
that partly right the truth that wa super jetlagged and brain dead scrolling through his feed and didn even realize had put out there the first place completely explains why pulled down immediately after finding out about later quite certain this what happened right dmorey long contritely point this out with public apology for making look like might have been posted purposefully this will accepted and moved from almost immediately edit least that all would take publically blow over here japan and feel the same true based off knowledge chinese culture too ,1
edit downvote because accept and welcome everyone whatever man obviously you have issue life you need help lmao ,1
yes civilised world will afford enough money nothing worry about hha ,1
you just going keep tossing around the billion dollar figure back ,1
mean bending the whim chinese fan caring about public opinion ,1
there good chance silver won cool with morey tweet then fuck him honestly doesn get the commissioner the league that encourages it player take political stance and then get angry over tweet like this ,1
like our logo seen hundred rebrand idea come through this sub over the year and have never seen one good appropriate our just wish could add little mustard ,1
really think absolutely horrible like worst the league horrible each their own guess ,1
apart from the unis hated the idea that the rocket were china team wa completely bald faced marketing move are switzerland team because have capela were slovenia team because bostjan nachbar morey completely the right here can tweet whatever the fuck want short saying something racist sexist etc just because there are billion them doesn mean that they are automatically correct the chinese fan can also whatever the fuck they want boycott the rocket root against the rocket shove rocket their as for all care the one feel for are the chinese that don really give shit about all this and will get shit for continuing root for the rocket ,1
just bit too plain starkly monochromatic white typically accent not the main color big fan stylized letter logo though and working the rocket into the seamlessly really well done every actual rocket drawing look too cheesy one way another and perhaps most all see franchise sort falling into category those that brand regular basis and those that don need ,1
matter how word basically saying that the money more important than the people hong kong ,1
too plain definitely how feel about like someone found the hey this look chinese font typed and then put circle around done agree that easy get over stylized and cheesy bringing actual rocket never really dug the cartoon rocket logo but think there plenty ground between the basic as thing have now and the pajama jammy jam look had the actually liked the one had the sub little bit back ,1
chinese fan root for the rocket that probably lower their citizenship score pretty sure don have chinese fan base all now ,1
morey creates more value for this team than china ever will being consistent contender keep ticket and merch and sponsorship selling being lottery regular keep the cash register quiet ,1
not literally you just love tossing around fake number ,1
tillman fired morey over non basketball decision would cancel season ticket tomorrow quite over tillman already can have le back ,1
seeing lot fan that are also quite happy with him one them ,1
support independence ,1
he good spot point shooter just gotta cut out the pull finally got another natural playmaker the team hit them ,1
you bowing public opinion either way either you support morey and get the public opinion boost america you can him get the boost china which will tillman bet whichever the most lucrative financially losing china cost him money morey may gone even make the team worse ,1
dont give shit ,1
not bot actual fan least real people crazy chinese social medium ,1
who morey did and tillman backtracked morey will probably tweet going back what say earlier don see any support just lapse judgement ,1
you one the only people have ever seen say this also think should keep the logo ha ton recognition this point you keep and tweak refresh color immediately recognizable and different from the rest the league ,1
there support you can reverse tweet ,1
yep happening tencent offcially announced weibo and several sponsor dropped deal including bank you see the back chair toyota centre ning which didnt even know they were sponsor and whatnot sad day for chinese fan but shitty move morey running business why meddle with politics ,1
better win the championship this year let see how those smug bastard react that ,1
while agree that calling out china when your team ha heavy fan base wasn the best thing will walkway support him for what said imagine all the people who were unaware the outright violation human right going hong kong now aware spread message supporting human right and you should always respect that ,1
dont care houston rocket not chinese rocket ,1
rocket game are probably banned china for the time being say maybe like month given the world short attention span the rocket org didn say anything wa morey and they could always say that they don stand behind what morey said and gain chinese favour again worst think last until this season then win the championship and shut them ,1
sure but business operator should careful with that should kept himself now jeopardizing the benefit the team wish everyone luck matter what ,1
it the fan over there that will suffer this could our year and they miss out because one tweet ,1
interesting when someone said something you don like don understand you just call bot this must the spirit democracy and freedom that you proud ,1
maybe you not worth penny the rocket ,1
the shitty takeout menu ha nothing with china seems for some redditors they find something bad they can just blame china for thats crazy while someone call free and independent opinion ,1
gotta say this wa puzzling move morey unless knew this would happen and didn care everyone know what happens when you criticize anything chinese may have wiped out year work from the rocket organization with single tweet just have trouble believing morey all people didn process this ,1
hahaha this the most hilarious and pathetic take ever seen yeah why not you leave nba for good you can all the rebrands you want ,1
this will completely blow over the world ha fucking short attention span how much outrage can the chinese propaganda machine manufacture over comment sure probably lost large portion the chinese fan base but lose them over human right atrocity think that fine price pay ,1
yes this definitely more pathetic than country banning any viewing sport team because one it employee said something you don like for supposed global superpower they sure get their panty bind over some miniscule shit why winnie scared morey and what tweet ,1
,1
this directly affect the rocket ability into the luxury cap hopefully temporary measure ,1
you care enough post about ,1
yep exactly ,1
talking about the place that have lifetime ban winnie the pooh tho ,1
play basketball lot and got grade mcl and acl sprain landing one foot awkwardly harden professional basketball player and obviously more durable than but putting all your weight one foot definitely put more stress ,1
they got vpn they are true fan ,1
fuck china ,1
what you mean scared you pissed off country and they don want business with you anything wrong with that you have find excuse say good news that called pathetic ,1
china big mad ,1
and you gay ,1
are still mad tillman ,1
everyone love le but wa the first get bed with the chinese obviously made him and many player very rich but you can see how the rebrand wa appeal china also the chinese takeout text gone now the only thing left from the rebrand the main logo ,1
lol you and are actually trying say the same thing then ,1
what exactly did morey ,1
always disliked the chinese fanbase ever since when they were attacking harden because jlin didn have the ball enough ,1
any the tweet were true chinese basketball association announced that they will cut off all cooperation with houston rocket rocket former superstar yao ming the president cba spdb rocket sponsor from china announced that they will stop all marketing and promotion activity related rocket rocket ha been removed from mainstream platform china for now don know what going happen next might banned for while ,1
dictator mad let fuckinng ,1
town everybody ,1
the jersey with chinese character and coloring that wear for chinese new year ha nothing with china ,1
can just loaned okc for minute after him and rus win couple chip houston ,1
snake don trust him ,1
fan did nothing the bottom line the rocket org doe not affect fan can good news for fan the houston rocket that are from houston because longer have blatantly pander chinese fan for ,1
know you not arguing good faith this conversation pointless but going able watch the rocket this season and your country mate aren because tweet that the reality here your leader banned basketball team from the country over tweet enjoy that and maybe ask yourself why government feel the need respond such manner secure it knowledge the right and the people truly agree with it position can wait for our new unis maybe get custom jersey with winnie the back ,1
backlash this the best thing happen the rocket since never been more proud rocket fan ,1
closing shooter the only measure ball defense especially league that us screen and switch heavy team lol ,1
good luck covering the nba without mentioning the champion ,1
the lost revenue will directly effect houston ability over the salary cap fertita cheap enough wa ,1
also solid three point shooter from the corner his catch and shoot percentage also solid but because his playstyle there wasn lot opportunity okc for that his off the dribble three are either atrocious miraculous and that what make him endearing would make boneheaded decision but make for insane way shortly after sorry just miss rus okc glad with his friend competing for ring but different hope doe win chip though ,1
lol ,1
know that the denver game probably his most historic but that point game against orlando where hit that deep from the right wing tie the game such underrated game his ,1
that supposed insult ,1
would think this actually pretty bad for the organization could lose significant value ton connection imagine player second guess signing with the rocket because hinders their perception china associated with the rocket they have brand grow and doing china big part any basketball brand the fact that yao might just never associate with again break heart too ,1
don get homering for dude that hasn played minute for ,1
hell yeah macho sjw ,1
let teach you some basic lesson firstly not government response the chinese people not happy about the stupid tweet secondly there loss not watching team that disrespected your country the real loss the loss hou revenue thirdly know you brainwashed the western propaganda but you need know that not everything driven the chinese government you capable doing your own research chinese community you will find out the people themselves pissed off hou and expressing their feeling there nothing about feeling unsecured whatever you tried claim gesture show that you can shit will ,1
interesting first did not group all commenters bot generally characterized that happening pervasively based observation secondly wife wa raised china and another country diplomat and run large intl business reit through china mexico and the don have absolute position the specific political topic have family there for business and visit annually lastly enjoy the freedom have being blessed self sufficient enough sit family and near the court hou game ma baby and hopefully few roadies and playoff game this season just pointing out that the comment are annoying you use the platform for sport and for the time being will control what can and not visit the comment certain platform certainly read certain comment feel that probably won like this pointy one for example damn bought tilman book shut and listen just get more insight owner ha been abrasive the fan base via his comment medium interaction and lack general fan outreach and read shit ton lmao ,1
think did potentially wipe that sense doubt expected because american really can grasp the sensitivity the situation from what see the medium ,1
sorry that wa mean and unnecessary but don come over here and talk shit while tryna hype please and thank you ,1
you guy will certainly have issue paying luxury tax remain competitive just because you hate your owner you need them make decent money for the overall health the franchise ,1
something tell that your name nowhere close being eric ,1
hardeneyeroll gif ,1
said the takeout menu not the jersey color course there are many other random thing ,1
bruh can wait for new jersey that aren chinese ,1
just don see world where the potential gain from championship this year doesn outweigh the loss the chinese fan ,1
this fucking incredible simple click and rocket might suffer huge financial loss madness ,1
well know you don want mix sport with politics but morey who did the first place and from this original post don know why anyone think posted bot just regular fan expressed his feeling what wrong with that ,1

dunno what like mandarin hung but english you put the space after the comma not before overall health the franchise luxury tax thanks for the concern but were doing just fine even before you guy heard ,1
tilman reddit account ,1
yeah numerically the hong kong fan base surely couldn compared with the chinese fan base but think can all agree that not just about money for right surely value like justice freedom and democracy are more important than making money that why have respect for morey such great guy ,1

that week period mavs orlando then denver ,1
interesting wonder still have some point left lol ,1
wa the key term here past tense china currently detaining million human rededucation camp and forcing them convert from their religion which fly against basic human right ,1
china and banning thing name better duo also too bad they can create fake version the rocket give their citizen like other thing they ban ,1
yeah agree with fan being able express their feel and there nothing wrong with morey expressing his feeling well but absentmindedly did not vet this with the rocket public relation department that wa huge mistake this your point there another post about the positive side branding but not super serious just trying find bright spot dark situation that all guy that close the rocket and asia right now saying this thing could actually get worst understanding wa may get better there will need something direct address from morey himself one thing that should highlighted for year morey ha been very engaging with his fan and vocal social medium one the smartest mind basketball and globally respected you know even though advised for danny ainge ainge view morey the slippery eel godsend the game his hyperactivity social medium and engagement with fan ultimately led this mishap unfortunately and this why other gm and coach not kerr avoid social medium entirely for fear something like this happening unfortunate have been able have direct interaction with one fav gm bobby the raptor being another childhood acquaintance mine and now will see what unfolds terrible situation that acknowledging but you control what you can going forward not asian mentality for saving face and permanent consequence for those unfortunate fortunate lucky edit there also danger this for american clash how thing are done slippery slope morey fired there will still anger but just from another group the larger nba market currently and constituent consulate just released their statement affirming the seriousness ,1
the bottom line affect tillman ability pay the luxury tax and therefore ,1
what said really trigger them this badly that all the proof you need that what they are doing fucked ,1
doesnt matter what they want it american franchise american soil they dont run the nba the rocket ,1
insane that the organisation being punished cause employee made statement private person but that how society work think morey will state apology but they fire him for that man ,1
literally did the opposite get offended lol ,1
and the main logo hideous ,1
all the way and censored china then that would crazy controversy imagine showing all the game and not showing the final ,1
ehhh most chinese rocket fan hated those jlin fan too ,1
new the rocket bandwagon hey rus can someone explain why china wa important the rocket why wa their logo chinese for the city edition uniform never made sense thunder fan ,1

when chinese people trying express their own feeling and you disagree you simply call leveraged the government that must the spirit democracy that you american are proud ,1
why protestors are always portrayed freedom fighter western medium even when they destroied the railway station and robbed the nearby store last night propaganda work ,1
choice would black jersey with this http www screwedup click content uploads city syrup big moe zro tyte eyez jpeg the main logo with the someone sign added the bottom the skyline ,1
nmsl ,1
would never root for this team ever again they fired morey over this ,1

this south park episode ,1
shit least someone the standing china ,1
imagine player second guess signing with the rocket because hinders their perception the fucking associated with team that lick the boot human right violator and perpetuators genocide ,1
think when people talk about defending freedom speech they aren talking about the literal legal right that people have the bill right they are saying that shouldn get such huge backlash for what said ,1
and recognize taiwan ,1
agree would stop watching the nba altogether ,1
hated the city jersey they always sucked and didn rep our city ,1
riot the language the unheard they aren randomly going out rioting for good reason ,1

nobody claimed morey being denied freedom speech know who being denied though ,1
yeah you think said something racist even demeaning the fact want other people have better quality life make you this angry say lot ,1
way yes but for good know that personal level place these value great importance great know that place these value before money although the other hand not nice see that eventually the big bully prevailed ,1
cool with team not getting cucked the chinese ,1
yeah what they can denounce all they want but stand with morey they are trying blackmail they can fuck themselves ,1
south park ,1
how you know that everything you are saying driven chinese authoritarian while you know nothing about the country see because you brainwashed western propaganda and why are you rude and angry because you can accept the truth ,1
the other hand you just gained lot fan ,1
that why clinton gave china most favored nation trading status short year after tiananmen square because justice and freedom are more important than money http tech mit edu china html ,1
everything litty love when hot bye felicia now just protect morey all cost ,1

seems all your guy can slandering instead pursuading guess you are not different from what you called chinese bot ,1
will there cheap off loading rocket stuff from china ,1
can say ever been rocket fan but this team absolute need win the final ,1
lol classic china trust from the philippine here theyre trying take our island now theyre trying take nba team from houston fuck off ,1
world biggest crybaby sad how people are defending and supporting entire country banning massive organisation and team because one tweet displaying freedom speech ,1
china popularly known for blocking world top rated website like google facebook twitter and many others freedom expression non existent china chinese people have learn think for themselves chinese communist party evil cult let morey and rocket proud being taiwanese democratic country ,1
just hope this shit doesn effect yao ,1
they fire morey going lose faith this franchise ,1
agree stand with morey this actually very serious topic morey did nothing wrong ,1
your filament sparking you might not supplying with enough current set your rocket off ,1
donald sterling also said something demeaning and racist while morey simply promoted freedom ,1
anybody reading this later please note that this good example bad faith arguing really obvious that this person saying inflammatory thing get people riled and then trying pretend that this will lead nuanced discussion ,1
will interesting see what tillman doe this point percent understand why distanced himself moreys comment and said want the rocket entity nonpolitical for sake his investment however not sure willing bend over backwards for the chinese market the risk some his american one stand with his last statement and hope this blow over guess one way another are going find out what the fertitta era the rocket all about ,1
chinese rocket fan are embarrassed ,1
bye felicia ,1
brazilian and started watching the nba recently chose the rocket because harden and nen can say that his tweet also made proud that chosen the rocket hope morey doesn back down and the rocket fact support democracy ,1
american born chinese dad from hong kong as trying keep head low don support the chinese government any way but don want have explain that every comment make all here toyota center when game ,1
capela wasn pick ,1
agreed ,1
nice standpoint but don care about either ,1
ayyy got the exact same jersey from dhgate while back too ,1
wouldn surprised wa made into one this season ,1
fuck you and fuck china ,1
really sad day for democracy morey get fired for this shit standing for freedom and helping make sure the hong kong protester voice heard globally super important what morey did wa not great for business but have much more respect for him now than before really hope the nba stand with him unlikely co money but did the right thing imo ,1
agree but don believe should fired for are the houston rocket not the china rocket what happening over there shouldn our way win basketball game the end the day here play ball ,1
yeah genocide the answer ,1
and your name not mfree ,1
support him understand that what did wa terrible from business standpoint but don care the chinese government scum anyway and appeasing them not the right move morally tillman fire morey over this done being rocket fan till sell the team ,1
worth ,1
dont think you guy are realizing people are going lose their job over this the rocket probably have department souly devoted for their chinese market interesting what happens next cause the only reason morey did that wa show some virtue signaling than wa dumb move but could actually make worthwhile then that would awesome ,1
your dictionary freedom mean the freedom burn mtr station and rob nerby store just search hong kong mtr station youtube besides truely believe advocating violence not morey want but his twitted bad timing ,1
agree they were demote his role assistant something like that still say the wrong move ,1
couldn have said better myself ,1
dude the cba suspended cooperation with the houston rocket wa that the chinese ppl the chinese government you can this ignorant ,1
dude messed because wa typing the damn mobile anyways considering how cheap your owner you should concerned about his profit margin your current core doe not win championship will break your core order avoid paying luxury tax still why care lakers fan really don want you win championship the next year when our window still open ,1
this whole thing will blow over best course action for the rocket aka tillman not anything that keep drawing attention this don think any non idiotic owner would fire morey over this since least some the revenue being lost over this wa going the nba not the rocket directly ,1
therefore protest fighting for civil right were wrong because violence and force were used ireland fighting for it independence the chinese government not logical peaceful protest going make them simply roll over sometimes force needed pretty ironic that supporter china are against the violence given their past ,1
look like rocket fan now unless morey get fired ,1
support daryl fuck china morey ,1
run the ppls isn gov not ,1
pretty interesting how many people are protesting twitter and instagram when banned there ironic really ,1
many are with you morey the reason the rocket have even been competitive not only doe the organization owe him the right morey get fired don see myself supporting the organization tillman can eat basket dick ,1
those were dark time ,1
yao can his the road cut tie over this bye felicia ,1
what you think about the police use force and violent anti protestors honest question ,1
just how like ,1
taiwanese fan ,1
like our logo well different than the rest the league and have significant history with now all yao and tmac now james rus usually take nike around season come with completely new logo uniform set court design merch etc think anything get something ready and then make the change after james eventually retires for the new chapter the rocket but would really prefer just keeping the logo and doing thing differently with the uniform style and color honestly prefer our previous uniform these new one not including throwback the new one just look generic like ncaa create team rocket especially the font ,1
and people over there think this black mirror shit normal sad ,1
think the business world employee have been fired for le but morey doe have lot job security being being high position the organization and really hard position replace that that said this whole situation ha morphed beyond employee tweet and kinda into the realm chinese western view can see tillman losing some support america bend over too much trying reopen the chinese market tillman fire morey would lose some support from his american market with china really effectively closing it market the rocket guess tillman ha couple choice wait out the chinese bend over backwards for them open their market again maybe just take win america and publicly support personally dont know what tillman will fire morey would lose home support but firing morey would probably open the chinese market the rocket the fastest like said this thing ha morphed from tweet really china western ideal area debate and whatever tillman doe really going telling what the fertitta era the rocket organization all about ,1
the fan actually want ,1
fuck china ,1
cya morey support ,1
you are the definition the chinese nationalism that this site doe not approve like seriously dude you not see the absurdity supporting government that literally want end democracy your goddamn president turned emperor with question mean were who the fuck still belief emperor right china for some reason sorry let reprase the chinese people are cool but your government man shit fucked ,1
yessir ,1
will longer support tilman this organization they fire morey over this ,1
tillman fire morey wont going the game anymore morey having free speech shouldnt get him fired all ,1
both cctv and tencent have suspended broadcasting rocket game ,1
shut tankie ,1
rocket are bad situation keep morey and you lose bunch revenue from china fire morey and you look like fool home soil ,1
the nba probably won stand with him but they won punish him for making this statement don really think the nba ha history doing such thing anyway and seriously doubt morey get fired were mediocre easy for guy lose their job over stuff like this but morey arguably the best the nba definitely the top and tilman the new owner that already kind finding hard gain the respect from rocket fan fire morey over this tilman would face huge backlash from the fan and ha nothing with tilman quieting the man who stood his ground and said something about what going china would case tilman just making bad basketball decision and getting rid the man who the biggest reason why houston the position they are right now ,1
support morey opinion correct besides that the reason that the organization ha been where been when many team just gave this point larger than money and basketball the nba and the rocket organization don stand him fire him and ice him out would very disappointed and won watch the nba owner choice ,1
zach lowe even said the jazz were top tier championship team and were border line top tier team and why said that because westbrook ha broke jumper like westbrook didn average game ,1
hard pas fuck out here morey all day ,1
sheeeiit http medium giphy com medium fzxa giphy gif ,1
lmao lay off the propaganda buddy ,1
honest answer they should not use force unless they feel like their safety danger four day ago one man wa shoot police when the freedom fighter tried attack the police with hammer you can check the footage youtube searching hong kong police shot protester the first gun shot from police four month ,1
really guy move wa upset like the rest all when harden didn win but let the end the day what matter most getting championship this just make sound like bunch cry baby ,1
now that money out the picture would great tilman just backtracked what said earlier but don see that happening ,1
don have faith tillman doe ,1
yeah damage already done anyways fertitta fire him after this pissed give morey will probably spend the rest his career fucking the rocket over ,1
all this pretty moot rocket wont fire morey over this the backlash from the american public would far worse than the chinese government ,1
morey probably getting reprimanded told stop behind the scene and the rocket will try save face imo morey won fired but fertitta will probably try get rid him later down the road the second houston bad ,1
get find out really fast the nba shitty the nfl the nfl blacklisted kaepernik for speaking out against police violence money wa more important the nfl owner will the nba the same direction ,1
ton revenue lost ,1
one silver lining come out this whole incident the fact that morey wa comfortable enough say something controversial mean that probably belief ha the respect trust the lockerroom and management staff far more than tilman doe and what mean that think there were some people who feared that tilman would come and try controlling and make bad move and morey might buckle under pressure because feel might get fired just doesn want disagree with owner for other reason step out line but being comfortable enough say stuff like this kind tell that tilmans presence the team isn going effect his decision making ,1
harden and lot our player stand with morey get fired some them are probably out ,1
the city jersey wa sick also wasnt just marketing thing you guy where home the greatest chinese athlete all time your silver lining for this dont like china glad you dont run the business darryl did honorable thing taking stand but not get confused the rocket just took major blow ,1
all this ,1
the chinese government really bottom the barrel poster boy for human right abuse they already brainwashed large part their own population act like they aren harvesting human organ and now are trying the same around the world ,1
proud morey hope stand what said fuck tilman and anyone who let power money make their mind daryl good guy ,1
what point did you see trying defend chinese government and being nationalism just comdeming violence protester and providing proof ,1
human right violator and perpetuators genocide wow sound familiar lol ,1
dont get why you think it crazy morey shit china and china the shit him it way overblown response but it china talking about ,1

morey the most important person the organization firing him would awful move now probably lose bit capital though might make harder take risk ,1
firing morey would cost the rocket much their actual domestic fanbase myself included ,1
are you sure the news you read western medium are not fake for the anti china narrative just thinking your way ,1

bitch bot ,1
yesyesyesyes ,1
not sure what you mean losing capital you mean that figuratively are you saying might get fined could see the nba maybe fining him some customary amount just make look like they are distancing themselves from him although don think there precedent for fine for stuff like this but suppose there always first don see tilman fining him the very least would worried for the future the team did one the thing worry about not morey getting fired but that would leave houston some point and year ago would said morey would never leave houston because the respect the city ha for him and all the work done but there real chance could just really doesn get along with tilman and about year there the potential that houston will moving towards being rebuilding team right about the time morey contract expiring there would window where would make sense leave and would think tilman realizes that morey fucking good his job possible doesn but tilman come off someone who ha followed the rocket closely for the past year and that morey leaf year probably dragging some the better front office talent with him his new team tilman would undoubtedly the top reason why and rocket fan would revolt against him because pushed morey away and morey still not even year old yet ha good year where probably top the league and that wind being for another team other than houston that disaster situation ,1
chinese whale stop playing the golden nugget and hello comrade chairman mao tillman ,1

bunch comment about hong kong belonging china also nmsl which googled and roughly translates your mother dead idk man shit weird ,1
not gonna lie this wa pretty funny ,1
well you pretty much linked the reason mainland china not exactly friendly towards hong kong the moment ,1
will always better rocket than harden harden ha only played season rocket and hakeem played argument now but guarantee there will ,1
fuck tilman ,1
contentious right now pick any side publicly and you hot water from some group just happens that there politics and money large basketball market involved and daryl didn mean ill will just the danger fan engagement one fear how harassed daryl will going forward the internet permanent place the other losing his super cool and unique fan engagement unlike other gm sigh ,1
forgot say shut but serious note this will blow pretty fast hope not long lived the internet cruel ,1
freedom speech exists until you annoy the country club ,1
although support hong kong you have understand the rocker have huge following china because yao ming tillman doesn wanna lose those fan ,1
protect morey all cost ,1
can someone explain why they mad him for standing with hong kong ,1
hong kong deserves it own entity china can get stuffed ,1
gonna mad morey get fired for this ,1
get that but why post publicly this just not professional whatsoever also isn tilman trump supporter lol ,1
harassed understatement his recent tweet almost reply ,1
politics sport you that soft that you can take another person opinion you waste time side note not losing money over this like til might still fuck him ,1
the prospect hong kong independence threatens chinese nationalist ,1
yeah shouldn said anything also yeah probably judging from the fact that white southerner look don like tilman but can see why doesn wanna lose chinese fan ,1
don understand ,1
chinese nationalist don want seem weak letting city against them ,1
china view any democratic movement hong kong secession you stand for any basic human right hong kong you are viewed pro independence rioter terrorist ,1
lol nba speak geolocation tag call out for local booty ,1
tilman cunt ,1
you dont publically rebuke your with your own account playing the politics side you get him delete the tweet and then send out official statement that worded not take side and apologize for any offense given ,1
the irony that and are banned censored there course everyone pay for vpn ,1
that how chinese cyber bullying work ,1
didn morey publicly post something political the fitst place don see any problem tillman legit destroying rocket oversea fanbase and the owner ha something ,1
fuck tilman for publicly rebuking the most valuable part organization aside from james harden ,1
this could get ugly think you just let quiet down and this filter are the non die hard fan idk what else you can completely out our hand there internet bullying get ughhh ,1
morey better not get fired over this bullshit ,1

they huge as group with opposing view ingrained lived next first hand ,1
yea got that now that not his job well both crossed the line ,1
mistake not the position have that right and freedom but vet the message maybe morey started another revolution imwt ,1
imwt ,1
they are mainland chinese supporter daryl picked the wrong side not only the nba get lot money from china the rocket specifically have had lot supporter because yao ming doe that mean daryl shouldn have tweeted that opinion but you hear people say business and bad business practice publicly say something that would hurt your business ,1
morley completely off this one live and whatever guy see the medium completely one sided these protestors started fighting for something that made sense now hey are just anti china sentiment puppet extremely disappointed with morey this one ,1
yeah this not what wanted his eventual tell all book been begging him for ,1
support morey yes don know what think everyone fan from china seems really upset ,1
what morey posted wa too damaging ignore publicly the dumbest thing done especially considering the rocket business and fan with yao and china ,1
omg even worse now because darryl deleted his tweet but tilman still ,1
maybe but tillman shouldn have called posted that either can ask morey remove privately then post official response like someone else said this make the whole organization look disorganized disjointed and unprofessional doesn matter who started the unprofessionalism that word the owner should end not make worse ,1
imo fuck the chinese nationalist great they support the rocket but they shouldn tell morey that his mother dead because support hong kong ,1
disagree fuck the tillman and fuck the ccp ,1
replied tillman tweet twitter and now have chinese troll commenting nmsl lol ,1
haha love seeing the baby beard soon will grow into full mvp ,1
yeah tillman doe not strike someone who shuts and listens ,1
yeah strongly considered posting something pro morey but million are going infiltrate your account have friend that live through this and are both side just not safe ,1
well that matter wording your mother dead pretty routine insult chinese ppl traditionally value filial piety and whatnot roughly equivalent fuck you guess seems very unusual translated verbatim english tho ,1
hawaii person harden won respect from nba hawaii fan not only did show but put out good show might have get ,1
this not good response from owner about his ugh hate drama our team ,1
best course just post ball stuff lol mean what else can you just posted lol ,1

imagine theyre just propaganda bot crazy future live ,1
unnecessary okc bash but houstonians are very proud the coast ,1
just when thing were looking great ,1
tilman probably got stuck his as because going try and run for office some bullshit ,1
hongkong and make sense ,1
yeah agree ,1
chinese fan here this point not saying that morey can say what belief correct but indisputable bad choice for the org considering his position the rocket and quite famous chinese fan due yao not surprised the org fire him for this not talking about small group nationalist million people ,1
isn defending morey because the backlash morey wa getting from chinese fan well not defending but trying get people back off lol ,1
you nation billion people million people really not that significant reason fire great because your people are upset that support human right and self determination ,1
tilman serious bad news very scared for this team year outlook push out morey fucked dont see james retiring here tilman drive the franchise into mediocrity with his bullshit ,1
yeahhh lol block them all ,1
bet you him want call them that word you know what mean ,1
all doe give the tweet more attention ,1
how this fuck tillman situation not saying against freedom the hong kong people more like damage control because morey getting blasted twitter ,1
think wa fairly obvious the thunder just aren good running organization yet especially not then ,1
already exploded china gonna have respond anyway ,1
you should never put money before human right specially when you have enough money last you lifetime ,1
don think the tweet wa intended against morey ideology this more like don hate our team chinese fan and investor because not speaking for the team that make sense ,1
they most definitely not propaganda bot many chinese internet user take pride going the march using vpn cross the great firewall ironic and flaming everyone and everything they deem unacceptable ,1
relax lowe the best basketball writer out there ,1
don think had choice the chinese were allll over that morey tweet now enemy those people just because that that sensitive and american can grasp that ,1
there are reason sponsorship fan viewership agreement etc don know how far this will but possible again don think can say but bad way and time say social medium morey himself should not delete his tweet truly belief what belief right chinese who life the for more than year personally don like talk about political stuff american but hongkong situation more complicated than what most western elite think human right and self determination what joke ,1
tilman absolutely the kind owner who would fire thats bad for business regardless success too ugh ,1
the supersonics died for incompetence and lolcow dom ,1
tillman fire morey then done with the rocket long the owner way grovel chinese dictatorship ,1
always fuck tilman situation but answer seriously because the last thing need drive away one the best gm the league ,1
china soft bully that trying steal ,1
basically these chinese fan view your view against china you should get fired ,1
not like fault for this situation morey tweeted something that can considered pretty polarizing and tillman trying damage control ,1
annoying how many ill informed yet extremely opinionated the discourse around hong kong atm reddit especially ha been cringe hell lately mod will crack down anything political and rightly all say morey did not think this one through also tilman probably hurt more than helped ,1
that dallas treatment ,1
there are thing more important life than money ,1
sigh now got this hanging over our head during camp ,1
don see much anything wrong with tillman post while personally have issue with morey post either from business stand point poked bear morey very public face social medium and other medium for the rocket him taking side issue like this bad move similar the kaepernick situation but ha whole mess overly passionate folk from another very profitable market that will taking aim him without the support from that market cancel out tillman just putting necessary distance between the tweet and the organization any reasonable business person would either have done have someone else short morey doing something crazy like antonio brown the team imploding isn getting fired troll either run out steam get drown out isn too worrying ,1
prop morey for speaking his mind fertitta slimeball ,1
tweet http twitter com robksports status ,1
really hope adam stand free speech tilman could this wish could acquire the team lol just hire retain morey and phase him into ownership over many year ,1
not about how fan view it all about business sponsor think this will hurt their market they will something ,1
lol just praying you don get bot attacked and this cyber bullying that happening morey and anyone that comment something positive him such hassle block most them lol ,1
mean he just doing damage control you dont want angry chinese fan stick around just because morey said something about hong kong it bad for the organization alienate that market ,1
honestly surprised morey decided tweet that begin with very smart calculated guy had have known this backlash would coming huge market for biggest this must morey firmly believing that some thing are bigger than basketball money dream job and willing risk all that take stance fyi have basically zero knowledge the hong kong china political situation ,1
you dont publically rebuke and shame like this even pulling the both side for authoritarian the way handle would privately getting morey delete the tweet and then sending out official statement with the bullshit pandering save the bottom line you have tweet you could just done this http twitter com aprilnicole status there that much concern abt the chinese market all had say wa daryl view are his own and not reflect those the rocket organization something similar but noooooo this wa the last straw fucking done with tillman dude need sell the team ,1
most them are bot lol most those account are just three barely ever tweeting till now why the message all seem copy pasted ,1
think you interpreting the tillman tweet incorrectly the owner the head figure his last effort try and stop the chinese fan not voicing his view against morey china going off morey now someone had say something ,1
he just separating morey hong kong opinion from what the organization think need have that association and cut off almost all your chinese fan because that ,1
riot the language the unheard martin luther king that even riot and not just widespread police brutality and abuse ,1
nmsl top ubricating ,1
then the dude should handled differently more accurately shut his mouth someone better handling this sort thing could done ,1
yeah but honestly don think nothing tillman the rocket twitter account could said prevent the outrage they screenshot everything and everything spread matter what ,1
the outrage would happened tillman made far worse ,1
china purportedly holding concentration camp for uyghurs who caress out the fan some point you have able speak out tillman trash human being ,1
maybe but think tillman only made worse for himself because people are gonna read this morey tillman situation when really tillman rocket china situation they protect moreys job lol ,1
ugh just wish morey didn tweet even though are all for freedom ,1
over now ,1
china start rounding hong kongers and shipping them concentration camp morey should shut because ,1
they would need back back historic come back hakeem wa dominant truly believe would beaten the bull even didn retire ,1
standing with hong kong polarizing understand insanely popular mainland china but american supporting democratic value doesn seem that wild morey deleted but tilman ha drawn even more attention tweet with his inflammatory response instead simply asking morey delete the tweet private ,1
the only one that think morey not going able work with buffoon like tilman ,1
please stop every time look twitter and see dame face fucking hurt enough waved team goodbye and instantly blew unfinished business turned into sleeping sickness ,1
worse for not defend one the major reason even have market also fuck chinese nationalist lol ,1
yeah they pretty much pushing the equivalent shut and lol remember shut and dribble and tilman came out with shut and listen lol can make this ,1
how old are you ,1
thanks now kinda sad ,1
while tillman could worded his response better morey get blame here think his post wouldn stir shit while knowing how much china follows the team ,1
well the reason have such big market china because yao ming the chinese nationalist are angry because their eye it like western entity rocket influencing secession movement hong kong even that not the case with morey just really shitty situation ,1
fuck tilman and fuck china you not familiar look into the hong kong protest and why they doing didn know much about morey beforehand but this major respect ,1

believe sad day ,1
don mind him saying that morey opinion are his own but wrote this like trump tweet simple morey free voice his own opinion but they not reflect the viewpoint the houston rocket organization would have sufficed better yet just say nothing and have morey delete the tweet story the morning then respond ,1

this shit doesn work against elite team game series fine over game sample size going against everyone but the playoff are all about overall talent level and adjustment between coach good coach licking his chop team that won use two third the floor it offensive attack all you have slow down stick lengthy wing player harden stay home the shooter and pack the paint don think every player our team should taking mid range but harden should take few footer game the only guy our team with semi good percentage from that area for his career ,1
where the proof this don like the idea accusing country killing own citizen just willy nilly with nothing cite lead down bad road imo ,1
bro china ha literal concentration camp with muslim and gay fuck off with that bullshit ,1
http wikipedia org wiki list killing law enforcement officer the united state and really need list how many civilian the troop killed abroad ,1

you guy are silly wa playing minute game and wa ending game the court not the bench not sure why many people are hung who start the game opposed who play the most minute and finish game all acting like wa playing minute game because wasn starter ,1
nobody america call that had never even heard patriot day ,1
,1
one rioting california because living under the much more attractive than the incompetent totalitarian shithole the ccp ,1
dunk ,1
rus can get his shot back should too you are right and rocket refusing take what they are given might have cost them honestly the primary style good but when not falling few can warm you know ridiculous but even shooting from rarely shoot until cooked the mid range ,1
http youtu blc heiu this what happening right now unedited raw video taken rioter student have been rage mode for month they carried metal pipe hammer heard the metal sound beginning etc and seeked out police officer and found one dozen guy chased and knocked down the officer and started beating him while the ground with whatever they were carrying handful other officer came his rescue one them pointed the gun rioter and asked them stop then one the rioter charged towards the officer and swung his weapon the officer and the gun went off think hitting the rioter arm better shown alternative angle cnn video but they crop out anything doesn serve their agenda and call news tell what officer texas would when guy went officer like that police officer did hurt some civilian but most the time the civilian who kept pushing them the edge not trying political here think ppl should have the right their freedom but don think burning bank subway station etc the way don think violence the answer ,1
didn really unload morey just said that morey doesn speak for the houston rocket like term the organization taking political standpoint ,1
one cannot tarnished with truth will leave that ,1
all race should hang out specifically with their own race ,1
and who gave you this sense superiority ,1
actually trying smacking harden the face duel with embiid dunking over someone wa that last season don really remember ,1
not here offend anybody say the guy who named his shitty book shut and listen ,1
http youtu lrrmjqjgsim ,1
http youtu blc heiu video taken one the rioter american officer would have unloaded them ,1
just clarify point but the protest aren about genocide they began result china passing new law saying people could extradited from mainland which flew the face the one country two system agreement ha obviously grown since then but that what this wa about people aren out the street trying raise awareness about the uighar situation anything ,1
http youtu blc heiu raw video the shot went off when the guy swung his weapon the officer ,1
missed the tweet from morey what wa said ,1
when his confirmation email came felt dat ,1
tend agree with this school thought tilman motivated profit this his mind wa his only option didn unload morey all but had distance himself and the rocket from that viewpoint keep the profit high the wording wa bad but not savvy linguist not saying tilman good owner but from business standpoint this wa the only move keep morey and try keep the fan ,1
say nobody whose opinion worthless hahaha foreigner who get paid doe stupid shit and must suffer the consequence own ,1
because the cop standing right there full riot gear had other option right wa bullet nothing punk mother fucker with badge and gun ice cube only one side pulling gun here and ain the kid with umbrella and stick ,1
thorpe smith clyde maxwell horry cassell ellie ,1
didn say anything about the probable potential action american police officer this deflection ,1
durant and westbrook did nothing for harden wa role player their team back then wa like clyde except didn shit for the playoff westbrook will useful houston but who know how much ,1
joke nmsl actually roughly translates your mother dead ,1
who started ,1
hahahahaha brilliant ,1
better for you foreigner learn your lesson and have some basic respect for people who pay you you can learn that feel sorry for you the world isn going treat you too kindly ,1
bitch you don pay for shit you watch american product and care about american team respect american value freedom speech kindly fuck off your dystopian social credit hellhole government flat ,1
before they came the rescue what point you think those kid with metal pipe and hammer etc would collectively stop would they stop beating when the officer unconscious the opinion that they shouldn seeking and attacking another person just because cop violence not the way the state people who directly attack officer are often shot site again don want anyone shot don push just want the violence stop before anybody get killed ,1
not for some reason this big hot button topic china anything year and morey stepped into major landmine this equivalent saying taiwan should independent you think getting attacked badly twitter the chinese basketball forum are much worse and bigger scale wouldn surprised the rocket take major financial hit china because this thankfully le longer the owner the team tie china lot looser these day ,1
you didn that opinion just watch the full video it source rioter ,1
chinese nationalist are the same time arrogant and extremely sensitive lmao basic respect as where the respect for the muslim the ccp are throwing into concentration camp where the respect for yourselves twitter isn even allowed china like what the fuck instead getting offended over basketball team thousand mile away get mad and your own government the rocket organization might want the chinese money but fan don give shit ,1
who care ,1
china the nba biggest market ,1
the dunk good ,1
sure your decision hahaha are not begging pay you you think this way your problem ,1
chuck ha always loved westbrook ,1
alrite will just stop watching and paying you then and fuck off with your value hahahaha you can shove your yankee hole together with that stick you already carry ,1
bye have fun watching the cba ,1
mean secret that trump supporter ,1
who are you tell other people how behave one want your money actually you better off china where reddit banned there one le troll here ,1
begone chinese bot ,1
actually like this second response the first one didn like because the morey doesn speak for the team part ,1
obviously daryl meant malice with his comment but this really suck see you only realize till after you say and suck how everything these day taken out context social medium celebrity whether it athlete actor etc ,1
who still care ,1
well least you not bot get happened extremely untimely event given the specific event hitting the medium from both side deleted tilman responded not perfect response tilman not perfect day crisis not completely averted mitchell reddick much lesser scale have gone through recently morey post tennis time will tell what happens rocket merch cheaper imwt ,1
most people not like violence bot ,1
sucker want our money tell sucker how behave simple ,1
well morey ha right opinion might cost them some chinese fan but well this american pro sport franchise will survive chinese politics will take some cheddar outta tillman pocket from jersey sell but fucking well whats going china right now appalling it not like morey said something fictitious ,1
read before and donovan mitchell comment sound like the initial soccer club lol ,1
what it not going bankrupt the rocket ,1
the chinese government ,1
everyone noticed that chuck dominated the nba even after his prime when looking out shape they had change the rule harden off and shape sometimes superb shape but that dad bod love sorry diverged from the topic mandatory russell westbrook rocket ,1
just googled and it related some chinese fashion label dafuq lol ,1
are they actual chinese fan government troll bot attacking morey odd that many people there suddenly have access open twitter when the great firewall block twitter http wikipedia org wiki website blocked mainland china there ,1
don forget there have already been multiple police pretending protester and causing violence under the protester name ,1
nothing value will lost when you leave goodbye ,1
actually sent email rocket ticket rep and told her tilman fire morey charge back season ticket and cancel ,1
get paid the rocket owner who get paid houstonions china doesnt shit you commie can fuck off and watch tier basketball the cba you aren happy ,1
worked democratic campaign clear lake got tillman cut check play all side whoever think may win like trump did prior ish ,1
fucking puppet ,1
it really funny that with all the slandering chinese bot and being brainwashed some guy just cannot recongnize that the western medium biased too someone just claim billion were killed china which absurb and still got upvoted seriously ,1
don think violence the answer yes ,1
money the land knockoff ha money now gtfo ,1
you don want anyone shot tell the people with gun stop shooting not that hard ,1
fuck then adios and the government actually threatening people over what sport team they choose support that should tell you all you need know about that government imwt ,1
one wa saying it injury risk except for that one guy from that specific nba thread ,1

finally system that fit his game and layup galore ,1
going last game played just couple min and then rested wouldn even risk that tbh ,1

dang trezz wa left the dust ,1
nice picture tired thanks for sharing ,1
thanks for the great photo ,1
hope really improved and isn mcw repeat last year ,1
harden ha caused several problem the rocket locker room with both starter tucker and clint capela unhappy with their teammate harden will they demand trade the near future ,1
lmaooooo cousin ray fat as but like super genius and really level headed literally like the genetic lottery that family for real ,1
never dreamed that after preseason game would most excited about chris clemons and ben mclemore ,1
think minimal effect for hype video almost always better choice the composition the video really cool ,1
yeah also don have westbrook out too lmao ,1
nor they mention that steph pretty underwhelming the playoff time well ,1
,1
the second wa quick ,1
dude that never touched basketball before yelling brick the most ironic thing ive ever seen ,1
don really have any hope never shown much least there tyson chandler ,1
love the mirror mirror photo the beard the brodie green http green taking flight both got out oklahoma city win win paul george ,1
damn wa hoping could have another try ,1
when randy murder pooh damn funny great episode ,1
miss this ,1
harden us front camera while rus us mirror ,1
take back word from the other day the team that nice quick release and hope can stay consistent more shooter are always plus ,1
just doe harden have visible gut ,1
boy been bad spot and this made happy ,1
fuck golden state ,1
everyone seems much happier and lighter this year ,1
use this site free and http watchraw com ,1
could not start over eric house keep playing this well ,1
still don know how the foul wa landry ,1
love that his shot fast ,1
hey hope you getting through alright man here talk you want ,1
thing will get better man hang there ,1
damn those warmups look sick with those harden ggreen wearing ,1
feel real bad for morey trying cut down this team nba roster ,1
but did you watch him shoot some those were deep ,1
aloha shirt from reyn spooner are the best hand down best material ,1
lol the reaction ,1
that wa not too long ago hang there ,1
yeah lack engagement and focus played like wa lost doe not realize his opportunity winding down need pay attention clemons and mclemore refer bennett with his unfortunate and ill timed injury dig really deep down understand that you only got finite number shot regardless mda and daryl raving review him wake hartenstein clint trezz you can another one ,1
nice shot ,1
this sub great full awesome people ,1
reminds that time blew them out towards the end last szn and that one guy wa going and about his hate for harden lol ,1
like zach what this lol tilman dig ,1
nah paul wa good too they just had creative difference the end ,1
zach lowe usually medium member have high respect for but having the jazz ahead the rocket dumb bodied the jazz last year they were match and know they added conley but that not gonna make them that much better will beat them game instead there argument for the other team though even though think are number zach lowe ha lost recently with the jazz take and saying harden isn top player ,1
dude ha lightning quick release ,1
not scared conley much bojan that dude can play ,1
word gotta add some the closet for sure ,1
don forget the king the fourth ,1
course think paul wa good and took far because the player but just think harden and rus are better friend ,1
yes lowe the only one that really give insightful take for espn see how the new crop pan out but lowe take the rocket ha been lukewarm best even the jazz addition the bogdanovic not significant enough maybe overrating our wing situation could underrating maybe somewhere the middle but feel that gotten much better outside the rus silo trade will see last night wa hard tell where the role player for the clipper were relevance ours since clint and harden were doing their thing which skews any comparison and the coach were strategized differently doc not likely driven win don think mda wa either but harden love hoop ,1
yeah and his brother assassin would love have his brother this team just draining silky trey ,1
clearly bit hyperbole but agree get off another slow start could see him firing mda overriding morey and forcing move that daryl wouldn have made seems somewhat reactionary imo ,1
don think they actually brother lol ,1
thank you knicks fan very cool ,1
you right the heck wa planted wa convinced they were related somehow terrible lol ,1
well are you real fan ,1
zach lowe fuckhead who always always underrates rus don give him your click ,1
wouldn call massive upgrade the position but hopefully massive upgrade term keeping harden fresh plus their insane chemistry will only rub off the rest the team ,1
not mention they essentially some knock off nba merch pretty sure nike some standard as short for well under that are the same material thereabouts ,1
think think westbrook really really good and gonna shine system like you guy run ,1
thanks knicks bro maybe all love see the day dolan sell the knicks donald sterling himself ,1
this houston team the same the team that took the gsw wcf but now they have rus arguably more depth and more gsw klay then mean ,1
lol really think usually objective and insightful and brings something different the table than others that just speak their mind without making complete consideration also walk you through his thought process and self deprecatingly make admits when wrong think rus will excel this season and will ease off and support providing context how got from where wa where then hopefully idk guess because compare him the other head that work espn are constantly the tube anyways ease off lol sense there deeper perspective here zach underrating rus which respect your perspective two the top tier polarizing player one team ,1
really need the throwback short both ketchup and white pls ,1
honestly that dope little victory dance for capela ,1
what pic not seeing ,1
lot star out for preseason game schwaggg ,1
please watch the video cumming inside sophie dee can found google video search always help ,1
bro you sound like nothing fan boy harden phenomenal player the best scorer his generation and pace the best combination volume and efficient scoring ever not taking anything away from him you can look giannis and see that ha that his physical tool are the best nba history then sorry you are idiot super mobile footer that while raw hell going give him certain advantage that player like harden can never have james harden more skilled course his step back money but still league wide inefficient shot and drop few percentage point for any reason value neutered the value giannis drive the rim will always have floor that will similar harden iso but giannis will bigger faster stronger until year old that the caliber athlete harden not that caliber athlete and the nba physicals matter the point being that harden already score with degree difficulty that while very good doing will never the case for giannis giannis will have the advantage any player front him for every possession for the rest his career can james bridge the gap skill maybe that remains seen but the degree difficulty closing that gap athleticism going harder than would for giannis close the gap skill for harden not exploiting the rule that laughable one who close follower the game agrees with you not executive not analyst not statistician not player not coach and not nba fan that knock him ha great strategy game that built strategy and btw the east project the weaker conference for the next year you can teach athleticism but you can teach least some degree step back ,1
any asshole that say rocket have hated giannis hasn spent any time this sub nobody ever talked shit about giannis just strongly believed harden had better season ,1
man sorry for bennett very tough break and wa hoping see him make that character return arc ,1
from espn you have more info this apparent tension ,1
nene out bennett out let see who step tomorrow ,1
harden made fun man purse this photo them battling the death tension are high ,1
boy game look like move around pretty well but telegraphed some pass and looked pretty green our there say the least ,1
mvp ,1
jesus christo ,1
use flashseats all the time and perfectly fine you just going one game have fun while you here ,1
the preseason game monday sat predominantly around asian fan who were there see the rocket but who were also into the shark they knew both side the court and wa interesting hearing them appreciate both side the game ,1
long time westbrook fan happy see shooting lower release point one issue with rus always jump super high for and often release almost the way down shoot much better when jump lower and shoot earlier ,1
got married near this hotel and lived the same neighborhood memory ,1
wa the one lost that fkn game against memphis man wa great but that foul clint iirc ugh wasn even foul ,1
not purse european ,1
wait tried stab harden over purse you think guy who make million year wouldn try rob his own teammate this headline worthy information thank you for your contribution and remember you said not ,1
satchel indiana jones wore one ,1
post http www instagram com ivwu fmqy ,1
this tension extended outside locker room ,1
caption immaculate ,1
now that some hypebeast stuff right there ,1
thanks wa thinking about this all day ,1
that chart just show that shoot shitload time doesnt really show anything other than him being little above nba average ,1
rocking the man bag ,1
sus ,1
shop til you drop boy ,1
pt pt the nba clear russell the mvp ,1
until you realise that defense the half and equal part the game you will never understand why harden didn get the mvp also for harden have these stats end have the second most usage rate the history the nba easy just look the number but you have see and how did ,1
they moved ,1
you guy teabagged them jesus ,1
clearly this why james took outside loosen and work his flexibility ,1
lil na pretty tall ,1
yep but still it gonna one hell match ,1
really that suck you have any idea why ,1
honestly this super dumb there are lot more influential people than her ,1
not the black hole used defense wa defensive win share last season not saying top tier defender anything but much much better than used usage rate dumb thing judge him for imo wa injured much last year and our next best ball handler austin river who picked later the season you said context matter ,1
that travel sincerely nba ,1
still bad defender tho and giannis wa almost dpoy last season see the difference and you are wrong about usage rate make sens someone have huge number when every play the ball his hand these thing matter the way someone accomplish something really matter when you want see who the better player ,1
usually the more shot you take the lower your shot efficiency don know exactly how shot efficiency and conversion rate are different but harden had around think possibly over point per possession something point last season know wa pretty ridiculous ,1
hate kardashian fan ,1
thunder fan coming here like visiting ex facebook page also getting all team ticket this year watch the rocket cause this look lit ,1
think this nigga bit confused ,1
underrated ,1
starting feel like the rocket have the same vibe going that the astros light hearted and just having fun can wait for the season start ,1
someone should show westbrook this graph point per drive pull ,1
not for that contract ,1
lmao she got famous off sex tape fuck outta here with that shit not you lol ,1
precaution had knee and finger surgery back may ,1
this sub posting really stupid shit recently hope just offseason thing ,1
not sure what more excited see harden being open every time rus drive rus driving open lane trying murder the rim ,1
just now realizing how similar these are the chief ,1
kenneth faried ,1
think tyson better match for james assuming pushing tempo when rus running the show keeping clint out there creates multiple position speed advantage james love the slower half court game and tyson old as better equipped for that james eric thabo tyson rus eric austin ryno clint figure out where and ben and house fucking deeeeeeep fit best ,1
the answer clearly yes ,1
don forget river also think you really want greenhouse effect along with the rus running game you make good point capela being able run with rus maybe the harden lineup could with more tuckwagon and anderson lineup compensate ,1
the legal stream were bad mine wa virtually unwatchable ,1
river house green and capela pretty much leg that can and run with him while harden tucker and gordon take bit breather ,1
green must for least occasion but would like see rus green river capela and either gordon house gordon for better shooting and house for more length and maybe even replace capela for heartstein really good looked against the shark ,1
this one make lot sense keep your best defender glued harden minute and then have your best runner and spacers run rough shod bench unit alongside westbrook plus gerald defense le issue against bench player ,1
been out the streetwear game for year maybe time pop back for little bit ,1
his contract wa basically little bonus and wa really meant trade asset but the nba screwed them over that nene probably going remain retired reality and might only something they seriously seriously need him ,1
that first lineup won net many point ,1
they needed mvp ,1
great prediction sam ,1
the legal stream lol choice but for move houston can get rocket fix this season ,1
anytime fam ,1
all hail the pancake emperor may feast game while feasted pre game ,1
james harden and would top scoring team the league ,1
could see the greenhouse effect with rus and not using ryno much just really like the idea giving rus the best shooting option possible rus eric house and clint could definitely put pressure defense house will need prove opposing defense can left open from because otherwise ryno the move due the extra space create for rus ,1
eric will the floor whenever rus james isn ,1
that most likely going the case but just wanna see how bench unit handle rus with bunch runner ,1
lol ain even roster think deserves role somewhere not sure what going and what the context seems like maybe holding out but the question for what wa contentious with the rocket during playoff over playing time ,1
who the freak ha she influenced besides the great pacific garbage patch ,1
daryl next experiment after winning champion ship draft redditors and win one ,1
hartenstein pls shine bright that can look your direction pls shine like supernova pls shine pls shine pls shin ,1
not sure about that really think austin going the guy whenever either those two sits you may right though can definitely see the merit having our best scorer all time ,1
her husband like time more influential than her lmao ,1
late the off season content running thin ,1
same flashseats worked for when ouston enjoy ,1
think house will step for shot percent last year and that includes him being worse after came back from the league situation and having his contract settled and not being jerked around think will help his performance ryno just doesn run enough for the rus lineup opinion ,1
kanye west more influential than kkw ,1
need new plague dwight schrute ,1
don expect house stay but look forward being wrong ryno can run but that not important since have enough other guy the floor that can not every play will fast break and you need someone that demand defensive attention away from the rim when rus dealing with half court situation house obviously better answer can that but hasn proven can yet ,1
fun fact the zachleetv account showing the like section the same guy that made the famous lebron game hype video where compared him lion and now make the pregame hype video for the rocket ,1
willing say near certainty eric the floor for every second one james rus sits our best shooter ,1
somebody tell tilman play for vet min and buy copy his book ,1
people don realize that post like that are obviously bait ,1
it bait ,1
why doe our marketing department not get through their head that these jersey look much better than all this new shit ,1
state income tax babyyyyyyyyyyyy hold that door open please ,1
lol the instagram post full homophobic comment people are the worst ,1
link ,1
eric starting which they have indicated then that would make the always being the court logistically difficult would mean either awkward rest rotation would mean one the three playing the first minute the game ,1
ryno the could interesting trailing shooting big would pretty nice when rus run into opponent protecting the paint and general forcing the opposing big out paint with rus ryno pnr would help rus finish around the rim ,1
went pretty viral the time here you http youtu ctav ,1
how operated the last few year not asking too much all especially now that have multiple guy that can plug the this year between house austin and ben can keep the floor all time and none them would have play more than night ,1
lol like any other business personnel they don want feel useless leaving their imprint they can leave their imprint bringing back the home throwback and retaining both permanently also visiting this sub and incorporating the astros colorway ,1
not against new idea but they need some good one like the stros edit ,1
definitely like see but what could the rest rotation are you taking someone out after minute because you have different rest rotation and none can concurrent then either one person get really late one they get really early short one and then later one make eric off the bench seem like good idea but all indication are they planning start him ,1
sort keep eric minute with rus for the shooting bringing the two them out around the minute mark for house and river playing with harden and capela then they can come back either the tail end the first beginning the second depending upon how long harden want play thabo good chemistry with rus come for bit later probably around the time harden sits too obviously chandler will not play every game but when have matchup where need his big body defense likely for clint little earlier than when and harden come out min mark ideally hartenstein will able step and play some center when rus running solo ryno even clark would also work small ball option because then can just play everyone out beyond the arc ,1
best case definitely someone stepping and proving worth starting the guess would that rus get quick pull like chris did that way when bring him back facing off against the opponent unit where will feast ,1
yeah agree there were some other good concept this sub before well wish they would consider certain fan submitted idea sure not hard for nike execute short notice for say christmas game and then get fan response and slowly deploy some may get hyped and out reach and they cut the inventory short they become these expensive resale collectible rare which will make cringe but unavoidable for business purpose many thing are bassackwards lol ,1
lol some diehard with the technical capability should record everything youtube haha the shark game wa painful wa jumping from illegal stream illegal stream and watching bunch site and youtube live stream come down there wa especially annoying one with giant translucent covering the center the screen would knew how haha ,1
thats dope cant wait see the hype video this year then ,1
did you try buffstream wa able watch the shark game there and ,1
don know you need league pas for this work but the nba app stream nba you provide login info for cable that ha that package start asking friend and family for the cable provider login have league pas and use the father law account worked well for the shark game ,1
gordon better than klay confirmed ,1
well did win one more game that week ,1
she basically created instagram not literally ,1
let get ,1
consider myself sneakerhead and typically rep mostly adidas and few nike jordan pair but think there way hell that nike doesn sign simply because the attention get wearing the hyped sneaker doe too much publicity lost they let him also think that would not want not able wear his nike the same time because the amount that ha already symbiotic relationship that just don see ending ,1
really want see westbrook gordon house thabo tucker lineup think small ball lineup with ton knockdown shooter will bring out the best rus ,1
you like the streetwear game game ,1
please dominate ,1
you have directly their site tried but couldn find the right place what the link ,1
hold this ,1
cool ,1
rus playing this one not until the next game ,1
next game ,1
back then nbastreams always had buffstreams but now yeah you have their site http buffstream live they usually post the game usually hour two before the game start ,1
his net worth le actually ,1
yeah chandler and harden should together slower game ,1
appreciate the advice but ima just chill the organization doesnt care either lol youre right tho someone might have cable level above mine that ha nba actually used have but never needed downgraded lol but thats too much work real talk and dont like asking people for that personal type shit plus would have access their whole internet home security phone provider account xfinity doe all least that ha financial info too you know what mean all know would never give login info anybody except brother which done already wouldn expect the same for thing pay for xfinity feel like this att sportsnet and rox leadership being cheap issue more than anything else maybe missing out something regard some expert level cba contract right negotiation shit that the fan aren privy maybe thats why the rox wont send craig assuming bill aint tryna overseas lmao and bull over hawaii and japan the clipper are sending fox sport west out there thats how nba broadcasting and the rap are sending their sportsnet sne crew japan http www nba com game houtor matchup there even proof the toronto sportnet website with the logo right there http www sportsnet basketball nba score like said the rox will give link tonight they technically accommodating but the part that annoys the past year the link info isn easily available and they don even drop the link till like hour best before the game and the link have been hella shitty not comparable product all for what pay for which minimum with the ability dvr dont have wake lol it ridiculous that have pay for pirate ask somebody for nba login just have access preseason game one which rus debuting wont need nba the rest the year all thats wild yes it the preseason and bitching like who care but consumer not getting the same value clipper raptor fan for the next game top that cant even dvr the damn game lmao you have watch live shitty link that wont drop till today until like amct for next week yall feel tripping too much fan bitching perhaps isnt that what supposed crazy wild fan that want watch game idk ,1
,1
this most likely sure fine but not worth aggravating something early the preseason ,1
net worth doesn equal influence lol ,1
late game hype bois just one more game until will presumably see rus play though ,1
money doesn equal influence lol ,1
not money definitely ha some part influence but say that kanye ha been more influencial than kim overall ,1
money more equivalent power than influence here the argument here that rapper and musician export product that impact influence the cultural moment our society through his beat and poetry more than keeping with the kardashians can even though ha more buying power ,1
yeah really don want him when klay thompson guarding him that guy wa intentionally trying hurt him last year ,1
green ,1
that helpful thank you buff stream wa great experience before just couldn think the moment for the shark game ,1
here not there and hyped ,1
japan when will tentatively play ,1
which pst ,1
the kardashian curse her cat ha influenced multiple men commit career suicide ,1
believe him but had such small sample size last year that hope all that work put during the off season coupled with mentorship from harden rus and thabo for his position specifically help him become that person getting paid play the role hope life and exceeds his contract and hope that make deep and win the championship this season then that add his veteran experience going forward making him smarter the bbiq side like many other valuable veteran out there show flash but need consistent part bbiq need whatever asked him there and study film his own and show self direction great seems have good head his shoulder and represents town would great feel good story ,1
deep just like our pointer ,1
there stress could put his leg well however practice the one legged shot going both side both leg good from that stance also will only occasionally use the shot have slight concern because one done before but pioneer ha take great risk his exploration short answer long answer god hope not because need him and selfishly all the terrible take and comment will create yuck ,1
hmm mean look good almost anything but that ,1
you just asking down voted ,1
same mean half his house are nike jordan plus grew north carolina just can see lol but gotta make them sweat somehow lol get extra bag two ,1
exactly this man know ,1
,1
man can imagine watching game lol ,1
wasn that small would have been much lower seed without him wa major star summer prior that season just fizzled out the playoff which would definitely overwhelming for someone going from league starter half season ,1
wa good team defender for basically rookie made all the right switch and didn make mistake didn display any particular aptitude lack thereof ball defense call him perfectly average with potential grow ,1
yuck ,1
game let goooooo adt ,1
sportsurge net the new nbastreams ,1
lot what wear unattainable for the general public isn like wearing nike latest performance model promote sale just promoting bunch rare expensive shoe which feel like would wear anyway lol ,1
man you surprised how large the market for high end sneaker ,1
brb getting some eye bleach ,1
beverley ,1
mod need letter excusing from work tomorrow this start bout kill ,1
your bos you have been excused from work see you monday ,1
guess aggregate did get good look him wa just thinking term extended run which the contract situation prevented from getting haven seen full regular season out him but did benefit from that that were able afford him the contract that offered rather than having bump significantly like would have had had played full season and performed the way had for last season consistently definitely hoping hartenstein make leap too because the league now waste his time and only going year older after this season ,1
tell about ,1
significantly lol ,1
still not know what this wa about lol ,1
people hating kim all just bunch basic bitch ,1
hope give him some tip how better defender offensively pick where left off the end the season not including playoff that all need from him ,1
woohoo three day weekend ,1
stockx goat someone like that should throw him the bag ,1
funny apparently there wa chance this could happened ,1
good ,1
kuz did goat but just landed with puma don think they threw lot him their margin must not that great ,1
much unpack here ever heard paragraph harden phenomenal player the best scorer his generation and pace the best combination volume and efficient scoring ever this alone reason why ahead giannis ha already proven that generational talent with actual performance giannis ha proven season you can look giannis and see that ha that his physical tool are the best nba history then sorry you are idiot wait you really think giannis physical tool are the best nba history wow and you call nothing supposed know btw fanboy lmao super mobile footer that while raw hell going give him certain advantage that player like harden can never have yeah height nba still game skill not raw athleticism which why giannis got shut down several time the playoff player who were le athletic than him will need develop that skill actually maximize his physical gift and not given that going that his step back money but still league wide inefficient shot and drop few percentage point for any reason value neutered how doe matter league wide inefficient shot efficient for him you also think curry point shot not valuable giannis athleticism because leaguewide more inefficient shot than dunk and thus drop few percentage point value neutered the value giannis drive the rim will always have floor that will similar harden iso but giannis will bigger faster stronger until year old the blueprint stop giannis already out there just stop him from driving and make him shoot until ha working shot skill his ability get the rim will become harder and harder can james bridge the gap with skill already ha maybe that remains seen but the degree difficulty closing that gap athleticism going harder than would for giannis close the gap skill this such bullshit assumption you literally saying that the decade hard work that harden ha put become one the best offensive player his generation will bridged giannis within the next year his called prime for harden not exploiting the rule that laughable you said relied exploitation rule that what laughable harden would unguardable even the rule were tweaked allow defender take his landing space and hand check and reach similarly giannis ability get the rim would also affected ref actually called his off arm push offensive foul and btw the east project the weaker conference for the next year the west ha always been the tougher conference and despite this giannis still ha final appearance don see them getting past philly this year and come back even his previous strength they going get dispatched the net you can teach athleticism but you can teach least some degree step back maybe giannis should learn how shoot normal pull shot efficiency before attempting something that clearly out his skill range right now argument which you completely ignore that harden ha already put together half decade worth great mvp worthy season giannis ha harden first mvp worthy season wa age and giannis wa age not like giannis mile ahead harden term potential just assume giannis will keep improving the rate that harden improved insulting harden literally every year analyst think that harden ha been figured out relies something that cannot repeated and every year come back with even better season than the last giannis can have another dominant mvp worthy season can talk again but until then harden clearly ahead because actually ha the result the board ,1
this kinda off topic but would love closing lineup against smaller time rus harden gordon house thabo tucker ,1
think going sick ,1
thanks got the ticket ,1
wanna see someone post pic bin everyteam besides the rocket ,1
and you are missing the point which reiiterate giannis will finish his career top player ever this not say harden won just that giannis will ,1
doe this include point from free throw drawn foul surprised his point per shot drive low ,1
anyone have his split stats between the middle and end the season when rejoined ,1
yes ,1
just look people like gandhi the dalai lama jesus nelson mandela all had and have had great influence the world but haven accumulated vast rich ,1
your hypothesis supported season data suggest finding yourself bookie since you clearly have time machine ,1
because the rocket haven won ring all that go away the second the rocket win the same thing happened dirk nobody talk about now the rocket win the next few year nobody will talking about game game the only two game where legitimately choked ,1
waste ,1
shame about this shit being ,1
mean love harden dude unreal how carry but mean that series loss san antonio wa bad look for him that loss when kawhi wa out that loss last year when durant wa out the way wa sitting the bench resigned during that comeback against the clipper had some tough playoff moment once win ring though that shit will disperse same way did for lebron same way did for dirk both whom had some bad moment their own and who were carrying similar narrative prior finally getting ring ,1
live for game thread ,1
televised ,1
may wake watch him play until done then back bed lol ,1
who care what narrative ppl create don such baby come season time playoff time harden will have shut them ,1
kim kardashian ha quantitatively influenced more people than kanye ha and probably ever will what you are describing based pure anecdotal evidence and emotion you may think kanye song are more inspirational than kim make and persona but more people have been influenced into making purchase towards kim than kanye more people watch kim than kanye advertiser pay kim more than kanye you separate power and influence but based what you think kanye cooler you value music more than okay that just your opinion overall more people prefer kim that basic supply demand otherwise she wouldn have the success she ha today she measurably more influential than kanye ,1
anyone who doesn win all considered choker doesn matter how many double team badly officiated game there are that just the image people paint when they only watch him play the playoff the houston fan who still think choker simply don deserve him ,1
the one thing need shoot better his stats rocket were amazing but you look his nba career outside the ish game last year for aren very good thought that wasn huge deal but then looked his league stats his point percentage wa not good the league ha high volume but remember guy like troy daniel canaan and rob covington took higher volume the league and still shot very good percentage could just coincidence not but can continue his high effort defense and shoot around the point while being ish free throw dude gonna special addition our team and will end starting the end the year ,1
because one game against the spur and that one game against the warrior people just think that when they think harden the playoff you take out those game actually been quite good people just wanna ignorant man they even say choked when averaged against the warrior kawhi lebron did that everyone would say their teammate didn pull their weight but with harden they say choked ,1
westbrook being healthy start season well setting screen and running motion play what could more frightening ,1
did you end checking out sneaker like recommended not intentionally trying jack your addiction haha ,1
may wearing lot hyped and limited release model and colorways but they still bring attention the brand the marketing strategy that when people try purchase the hyped sneaker and most inevitably fail that they end rage purchasing others and quench their thirst source idiotic consumer that try buy hyped sneaker ,1
think there might chance sign with someone else the money disparity between offer enough personally have adidas bias and would want see him sign something with them there also chance might trying negotiate his own signature shoe which could warranted given him being the nike shoe god ,1
yes don subscribe haven joined because enters lot idea head but one browse periodically since you recommended thank you addiction little tamer now lol have way too many and kobe right now lol been lucky the sneaker the last couple cop luck ha end soon with the law average lol ,1

iirc the real split look how did against contender other team need learn how play well against good team ,1
get this shit off screen right now ,1
lmao love feel like you must have used this one before witty ,1
missed half the year and wa not all that great only averaged like that series including point close game besides him and ariza wa scrub city since dmo and bev were both out with injury and both game one and two were one possession game that were straight handed the warrior the ref even getting just one those would been huge ,1
combination thing but come down the fact that typically doe not play well high pressure situation doe throughout the course the regular season and comparatively larger margin than other great player ,1
foh will always love bev ,1
kanye literally one the greatest musician our generation fam lol ,1
someone need pay him big and let him make some awesome shoe ,1
not worried about all but defensively showed lot promise but step away from becoming great defender ,1
the kardashians are literally one the most successful family the world one them literally became billionaire recently and that only happened because kim kardashian you really gonna tell that billionaire le influential than rapper who net worth le than that mean like his song too but mon his recent stuff hasn even been good ,1
there still slot left open upgrading well ,1
thank ,1
guess you can say that but measurement would you right ,1
lebron point wa bad dirk one ever mention because people are dumb ,1
copy and paste ,1
when will they learn ,1
fuck bev for hurting rus ,1
until proven otherwise still think gimmick and won much real game could see being useful rubio guarding him his left side but other than that don see the point ,1
whose pic this ,1
literally have idea who that edit lol read comment didn even recognize wa kim kardashian ,1
dwight wa actually pretty solid that season playoff dwight wa quickly forgotten remember correctly dwight hurt his knee game close loss and wa not effective after that but wa pretty stout against dallas and the clipper sans free throw ,1
kim kardashian the definition basic bitch ,1
look like the vascularity wa inherited ,1
doe toyota walk ticket for preseason game time may have baby sitter town one weekend but wouldn able commit until the last minute probably past tipoff ,1
,1
indeed right now have you plus more martel and hooker ,1
cool ill keep you the loop ,1
what the link for the jersey edit and yes tine with ,1
hear that that the sound heart breaking wa hoping see redemption story best luck and quick recovery him ,1
his vascularity pretty impessive ,1
same shattered really would have been good fit could earn time and what did last year the league hit long shot consistently and make sound read this tough break you can get when you working your as off get back into the league after being pick really hoped watch his arc come all the way back sad hope get chance again soon and more importantly hope his mental state well enough and stay resilient what want because this type stuff cannot imagine coming back from but really went further along than thought would his path back ,1

really put into perspective how much harden had just for the rocket win his assist would have been higher with potentially le ppg had more competent player around him while wa out let hope this year harden doesn have much rested the time the playoff are here love those net jersey glad see succeeding last season after many people wrote him off when the lakers drafted lonzo snitching young ,1
you hate pretty much anyone and can see multiple side and perspective then yeah kinda basic ,1
when did say hate everyone you all are trying say kim kardashian isn basic when every girl act like her ,1

yessir ,1
bet that harden someone with the rocket have reached out the ref behind the scene show them what going and make sure isn travel plus sure that ref watch lot tape game they reffed and there probably lot conversation about the call they got right and one they didn get right ,1
basically the same idea behind why when someone driving the basket and pick their dribble before getting the free throw line and they take two step before they have immediately take shot pas the ball ,1
will wait buy the day off unless really expensive team watch like the lakers warrior ,1
shot pocket ,1
wow finally some workout footage for rus love the guy but man doe keep his workout secretive btw might just over analyzing these clip but from http youtu kld vbcc westbrook jumper seems resemble motion shot than his usual motion jumper ,1

stats shown before the shark game didn even realise the bottom two happened dude another level ,1
there much that happened that can even fit this screen basically everyone will remember his season the long term just insane what did and damn improbable not impossible replicate mean how and getting better explain mvp ,1

would say more thin strip ,1
had slasher as shooting with rating pointer ,1
too wonder this wa going ask kelly iko the last held but missed out following couple the strength coach lmao like stalker but not the skill trainer any ,1
people not know how read social medium nowadays said want compete the highest level would easily out okc now wa taking le and doe not want rebuilding team course understand that lot money give away but you can possibly feel bad for someone taking mill year when for fact must know his play not worth million year and even doe believe his play worth that much for fact know that signing for le would make easier win which ha said many occasion that want win you also comparing regular job playing the nba which completely different and not comparable any way all ,1
tweet http twitter com rocket insider status ,1
elston turner replaced bzdelik they promoted somebody maybe gunning not positive and added dan hartfield ,1
then most dunk and layup are travel well ,1
this going come off dumb question but what app you guy recommend listen these podcast sure there faster way than going each unique url each week ,1
damn that like least fan ,1
buddy always say that his gauge for who should win mvp deciding who ha the most memorable season who are going remember when think that particular season year later sure ha hell ain giannis ,1
yeah kind suck mean everything china associated with except their epic history ,1
lol many referring the million rocket china not just the fan the pic smart as ,1
obviously lol just pointing out the humor where find ,1
lol all good bro ,1
hmm that make sense for all the other firing but not roland because think harden brought roland not mda maybe roland wa asking for too much money for fretittas bare ,1
hopefully this work out ,1
yeah people not understand you get two step ,1
here you you poor soul http twitter com nbaofficial status ,1
you can usually find them spotify but been using the podcast app io for while now ,1
wa clearly robbed hated then robbed cool though like ted williams hitting and not winning the mvp the medium clearly simply doesn like harden and they don bother hide the bias against the beard ,1
perfect thank you ,1
year the voter for last year mvp award will laughed ,1
bruh didn even get pt all team smh scrub ,1
who else ha had multiple game the same season ,1
take ryno over game ,1
pretty sure the rocket social medium mentioned the point tour unbelievable stat ,1
think with lot award this should what decides ,1
how the hell you think harden should able score pt against all team should they face their own team ,1
mashallah ,1
joke dude ,1
not joking ,1
lebron had those stats would unanimous mvp ,1
lmao wa joke don like putting co that dumb but guess should have ,1
wa robbed last year for sure and rooting for him win this year but sharing the court with rus gonna harder pick chef curry gonna get max shot with klay out and ha something prove everyone saying the dynasty dead steph gon coming hawtt ,1
never thought the day would see rus playing off the ball with cut and screen houston going dangerous with ball movement and even more dangerous wit rus and harden buying ,1
the thing with curry that there klay take off defensive responsibility for him it going consuming his energy having guard the other top guard the game and dont expect them high enough seed doubt win mvp even somehow average close ppg which dont think can tbh consistently with defense going garner attempt stop him mainly ,1
killhitler ,1
that good point getting doe help relieve some that pressure but where near the lock down defender that klay interesting see where they finish they still got steve kerr system which very pas and move orientated find the best shot which allows almost anyone score with high shot along with curry vision can more than just score win the mvp just ha keep his body fit had some reoccurring injury also ,1
never even sniffed the round with him and the year had chance make some noise decided his body wa going break down ,1
had that same thought but with the oscar ,1
remember being livid when decided shut down that season think almost traded him for vince carter that being said think his overall work with the rocket deserving have his jersey retired ,1
sadly because injury wa more big name who played for the rocket than anything that said yao why not tmac ,1
nah it giannis irving dame ,1
jesus can you guy give rest already ,1
give rest already ,1
this wa him before billy donovan one favorite play lob for rus handed slam ,1
cause yao career rocket ,1
like not being top seed ha been criterion all but medium vote first wa from seed and rus seed debacle the snubbing most worth being salty about james made his last free throw could call robbery just sad but reflects how let too many winnable game get away from that game wa absolutely unforgivable along with many others and just barely took him out the conversation hate the voting criterion not the voter ,1
beautiful go but can hit the time gonna bitter keep letting them fly instead finding something better ,1
wouldn turn down either but then again you should expect being trade bait ,1
over critical the rocket root for other player other than harden for mvp ,1
hope doe fav player ,1
constantly complaining won change anything just make our fan base look bitchy been month get over there whole new season ahead ,1
think this the same picture from when the jersey were originally announced which iirc wa before the westbrook trade they were showing harden and jersey could totally wrong though ,1
because his body work houston rocket not worthy jersey retirement ,1
had historic season not shutting about ,1
didn really much rocket because injury and just spends his time now talking shit about james harden because insecure fuck that guy ,1
yeah everyone know that but constantly bitching isn going change anything ,1
the rocket subreddit the pre season about start this really the best time look back historic season plus don think will ever see more dominant offensive season ever again especially last january ,1
you really should inspect his number and resume before assuming ha the credential for such honor harden will have many point rocket tmac doe the the end for example ,1
hell wa favorite player kid but hindsight three all star season two all nba third and one all nba second isn enough get your number retired top that wa literal chucker the playoff for did better without him and the way left leaf sour taste mouth every other player who number retired did more hakeem our goat mose malone won mvp and brought the final calvin murphy played his whole career rocket rudy almost died the court for and led championship head coach and yao ming helped explode our fan base astronomical amount what ha mac done for the rocket besides disappointment ,1
daryl post http www instagram com henf ,1
giannis improved whopping point rebound and assist difference between him last year and this year wa the rest his team and coach bud meanwhile harden wa playing with crippled rocket team averaged for half the season and went from his average the highest seen decade mvp team award individual award there just need more defined answer what make mvp making history being best player the best team but would anyone the warrior would have won mvp last year with their stacked roster they finished first people even said having and curry the same team lessens their chance winning mvp what medium found their new prince child congrats giannis ,1
dang harden watched the kawhi clip and might have intrigued the idea not putting that third step down hence one legged shot sure thought from another source but can see clearly based kawhi example the benefit and how can perceived travel but not harden god mode unlocked ,1
clyde also get point for being native houstonian and being part phi slamma jamma not for those thing not sure get his jersey retired ,1
zhou sing happy birthday ,1
the illegal stream were bad for the shark game wa terrible the remainder preseason continues this way going have league pas hulu slingtv whatever the heck disney come with after their disney deployment november ,1
the spent def worth the headache dealing with illegal stream plus the quality distracts half the time anyways most the time watch the game after live broadcast anyways ,1
feel you just purchased ton jersey throwback harden icon rus association river and not mention random hakeem practice jersey have procure subscription through wifey lol putting together business case for this need life and contemplating all her point about how this take away from our time quality time with family daughter watch with ready what kind plan were you thinking group buy and sharing account having one account and mirroring idk the term haven had subscription for two year have brush what the account restriction and limitation are now only three can logged once etc remember them being fairly lenient before but don know about now ,1
seems that coach are actually little worried about playing against but the medium too busy saying usage rate see the advantage rus could bring our offense ,1
not many people remember that mac left the rocket bad term too ,1
lol like how fancy james then rus like naw ima just pull ,1
starting wonder the majority the medium that cover basketball even watch they just get list question from their editor designed elicit soundbites ,1
lol need each play their strength haha have you seen the rus training video they bit long but you can see the date printed the screen and just got smoother with his shot and off ball movement the day went look like practicing with bunch lacrosse player that are good with the stick trying smack the ball away hope translates but realistically need get real rep real game action can wait for the game japan ,1
it because rus and harden are two the most polarizing player ever play the game come with the territory tbh considering the medium isnt very fond them overall also ,1
and they have the reaction and response should really value because they looking the film deeply and studying the team unlike the casuals and some the medium that are spread too thin focus the rocket hoping for good health and wellness for the team and league because you love see this work without setback ,1
anchor bias feel like many medium member their outlet have anchored position many season ago and can get away from admit out pride and there still chance they right and they banking that ,1
because doesn deserve one ,1
and yao didn try dodge getting traded talking out the medium and getting rush surgery mac wa selfish and never about the team ,1
,1
being sarcastic ,1
only person heard stephen saying people aren talking about the rocket enough ,1
uncle unko they say and aunt going facetime lol they just got their kid cousin out the nest they living borderline lakers fan though lol ,1
you need convert your cousin rocket fan ,1
thats true think the split wa softend him coming back from injury and the fan base wanting move degree guess what saying there ha been worse breakup the nba which help with mac rose tinted glass ,1
haha been trying compel him this the season sent him sticker mousepad and some treasured memorabilia chuck hayes auto lol ,1
but the voting criterion defined the voter ,1
just got auto renewed for one team pas and that what reminded restriction are device one time that shouldn problem unless did all team pas but honestly not sure would want spend the unless more people join not sure would even have time watch more than the rocket lol ,1
have youtube sub and month but allowed share with other account just type their email and add them and can remove wish get some friend that pay slot really convenient all basic cable plus live sport would have see can get all the game playback not and what the difference the league pas package you find out please update this thread with comment can catch all the season too ,1
doe anyone know league pas will work austin bought year ago here like year ago but the rocket game were blacked out ,1
yea think they may blackedout you get att sportsnet there you use computer vpn work for io haven had luck they require location never tried with apple but could possible you have home network vpn setup rig something ,1
harden gonna one those great that get shit and then few year later everyone will say shit that guy really wa special everyone move goalpost hard him last year everyone said they give him their mvp vote did one thing and then when did they shifted something else first wa get houston hca then win then surpass kobe ppg then wa ball out the playoff then did all that but apoarently wasnt enough idk how guy who averaged win team the only all star elite conference doesnt win mvp but whatever ,1
had the full league pas for year and never had issue can watch spur game when the rocket play them you screwed ,1
people argued lebron over harden but when harden put better stats with more win tougher conference with le all star teammate against worse candidate than harden somehow doesnt deserve lol ,1
kobe and wilt off the top head that might ,1
yea dallas when they play the mavs either watch their feed use vpn the laptop have wait till next day they replay the game after typically ,1
really like the chandler pickup dubose tyson chandler the most vocal guy the court almost like having extra coach the floor http twitter com bendubose status ,1
are you htown doesn youtube know your location and give you local station you automatically get att sportsnet southwest addition all the other region ,1
have the full league pas and down get person join well ,1
word you already purchase ,1
yeah have set auto renew ,1
yea same but have team pas which honestly all have time for going see who else join the thread ,1
wa considering switching over however like being able watch what want when want damn millenial desire for convenience also hard watching the damn knicks and getting hurt every year since the ,1
give you local station based off your location from houston but south austin atm and houston sport game typically get blacked out here and forced watch the ranger and yankee etc but record your team your following them but you miss those blackout game ,1
well team were already afraid the rocket last year the rocket were really the only team gsw respected and wanted beat out the west westbrook really doe give different dimension attacking the rim transition that really didn have outside harden going coast coast capela rim running but harden did not have the energy that every possession and did not have the footspeed outrunning guy excited see the variety offense that inserting westbrook allows ,1
wait where are these video ,1
that running theme with rus player and coach respect the hell out what doe but the medium act like the most overrated player the league because his shooting efficiency and usage rate ,1
rockpileindisma wong ,1
because picked the lakers beat the rocket when wa still the roster ,1
bring him home ,1
rus can hit the whatever league average going useful think becomes cool playing off ball and playing defense don forget advanced def stats loved rus last season rocket will hella dangerous and rus keep passing james harden winning mvp ,1
whoop ,1
that hilarious reddit suggested the unpopular opinion channel for because astros rocket cowboy fan guess ,1
honestly feel for giannis because his potentially first mvp season marred obvious medium bias looked damn uncomfortable having deflect after winning the award what wa obvious the nba need new blood star age out the league all the younger guy giannis wa the best and his team got the most success anthony davis ball they would try give him this year ,1
that why don listen the opinion anyone who hasn actually played the game looking you ringer staff ,1
talk shit sbout harden people wont call him homer still go the game alot and still seems support rocket ,1
they enemy mine ,1
chill out bish ,1
chill out with your sarcasm this good question wong sirjackiechiles just tagged two mod hopefully you get banned ,1
dude wa letting him know stop projecting ,1
you fast lol ,1
wong sirjackiechiles this hoe body would fun for day but that face gotta ,1
wish had houston radio station here during occasional long work commute the greater area ,1
what the best way get the most rocket game living houston every time look subscription the game are blacked out ,1
ben dubose ,1
hot take and steph will comin hawtt but doesn get mvp again mvp will gerald green ,1
for just rocket game ,1
lol those aren mod those homeboy thought wa funny ,1
just the way nobody here ha said giannis didn deserve his mvp just think harden deserved more had harden won and not giannis this would the other way around called opinion which nature subjective and support our guy same thing happened when wa harden westbrook for mvp ,1
there hate for giannis just combination the love for the beard combined with the lived through appreciation what did game game micro level versus what the medium wa saying going the macro level fair didn watch much buck game the criterion used the primary driver wa win which ironically the rus harden for mvp year come mind where the framework used seemed have flipped and presumably for narrative regardless they were both great and harden rocket fan unfortunate harden ha le year ahead maybe than giannis who will have ton opportunity hopefully that where there small pain point harden wa insane last year and wa giannis there wa never going unanimous and certain closure this only time will tell which season wa more memorable ,1
agree putting wack and ruin the joke would far not even mention which seems added ensure wa known you were joking funnier just leave scrub hardens mvb ,1
giannis doesnt have that what the word swag ,1
the league wasn ready for january james ,1
cause it hard get any power from there ,1
okay from perspective james harden had the best offensive season history and not even particularly close giannis ha greater way impact but ultimately didn even have top ten offensive season the past decade the main problem hear the elephant the room giannis going down barring injury top player all time just that good pass the eye test way that personally never seen from prospect before the perfect athletic specimen and only scratching the surface the point that giannis will have his time and will have lot over the next decade will compete for title win imo multiple mvp dpoys etc witnessed something that wa far and away outlier analytics sense that having giannis mvp seems premature seeing may look back this season from him bottom season his career say james harden should won mvp this year not say better than giannis just that wa better this year and detracts from harden case top all time great when giannis may well penciled this point ,1
,1
you willing spend buck month you can get the tune radio app which will give you access all radio broadcast rocket game when went school ohio used for all rocket and astros game ,1
ohh aight lol bad ,1
this the quality content came for finally some shit for men ,1
strike ,1
down for like all team pas that like piece not bad all ,1
very well said couldn agree more there were many ups and down game where wa full display how great wa going toe toe with the fully healthy gsw squad and coming out with that crazy buzzer beating deep three and game where wasn nationally televised like the grizzly game where did all could and had total and like point the last min the and but came away with loss but throughout all the beard fought tooth and nail keep houston afloat through insane western conference season that rocket fan will cherish more than anyone else could ,1
yes ,1
att sportsnet stream them online find someone with cable subscription use league pas with vpn ,1
let see how many ppl join ,1
thanks for the suggestion might have explore don reactivate league pas again which also had some broadcast but not all ,1
giannis had great season and him winning mvp isn that big deal but harden just seemed like the clear cut mvp ,1
youtube give you local station ,1
excuse you have little bit ketchup and mustard your clean white shoe ,1
jordan ,1
man wa playing recreational league last summer and wa fast break defense shorter guy challenged the rim and the mfer lead with his left elbow knocked out two front teeth and cost get sorted out since not bad the video obviously but fuck wish would have pay for dirty play ,1
isn anchor bias just bias ,1
buy ,1
what happens win chip and the position they took stake just wrong ,1
she like men who get shit dun ,1
they not worried about the long range shot they worried their team won get the rebound after the miss and just dunk them throw saucy pas yell there bench and stomp away cause end doing something increase the lead anyway probably the only player that literally demoralize the whole front seat coaching staff cause stopping him from shooting driving doesn really shit ,1
they blame something else durant wa out this year clay thompson wa hurt curry had carry the whole team his back look how good did they almost made the insert team here other than the rocket just figuring our their chemistry they dominate the rocket next year wasn for insert injury another team they would have beat the rocket come man you know how this narrative go ,1
anyone who say they have chemistry issue are the one who just started watching basketball and nobody should take their opinion seriously realize medium people say too but they always talk out their as about cause they hate houston and westbrook fine with them underrating prefer the underdog status ,1
absolutely the second one lol you ever see max kellerman talk you realize instantly the medium get their shit from nba lie they just spew the same shit from there ,1
yup you already know they gonna pull out every excuse the book win ,1
giannis ha blow job bell ,1
disagree few point don know can pencil giannis top all time player right now develop the open his mid range game and put few more year with ridiculous number then yes really hate the argument giannis young and will get mvp the future that shouldn factor into the mvp vote all just pick the better guess more valuable player ,1
why you here every day youre not rocket fan harden had legendary season and pulled his team out the garbage can and put them championshio contention ,1
harden wa both the better and more valuable player last season ,1
this agree with ,1
that cruel ,1
medium narrative won him the mvp that what hate have problem acknowledging that pro but eclipsed james harden ,1
feel can wait till westbrook first game ,1
just going stick with what know and thats harden got robbed plain and simple ppg legendary season they gave giannis foreign and wa born with limb long enough that enable him dunk ball dont care what anyone say harden wa robbed and the superior basketball player ,1
,1
you gonna tell him buck fan ,1
sportstalk iheartradio ,1
can that ,1
yes bro went the shark game hyped then realize wasn gonna playing the first two game haha atleast the ticket were cheap ,1
clean almost too clean but damn they clean ,1
get his hoe that ,1
wa never tempted back from live till now ,1
those shoe gonna grey real quick mine are any indicator that white strip over the string son bitch clean ,1
can full ssol now whether not that good idea given how much wear down player who know ,1
there also more life than money year but limiting your chance win year and setting for team success think it fair say that toss for what make you happier can imagine what it like making million year but sure some point the law diminishing return come into play the joy winning championship would priceless for many people ,1
all life been grinding all life ,1
really more vocal than lmao ,1
pass the eye test way that personally never seen dude just don get this perspective just watched the top play from his career posted month ago and the sequence wa this dunk block running dunk steal then dunk dunk over guy dunk dunk spinning layup dunk stepback buzzer beater from about away guess spoiled since harden doe this kind stuff his sleep while having ppg more each season what exactly make giannis special besides the fact that likeable fast and ha long arm why doe everyone act like going top player ever ,1
anchor bias bias but not just bias more specifically anchoring cognitive bias where individual depends too heavily initial piece information offered when making decision this case wa thinking that the initial position medium member casual fan took what they would continue heavily depend even after debunking ,1
jesus sorry hear that happened you hope thing are better now really should have paid insurance ,1
picked the same one the preseason opener monday dope ,1
yeah those guy aren mvp ,1
yeah for the initial work and just spent two dental implant since killed them when knocked them out insurance covered since chose not the emergency room thanks for the well wish wish wouldve paid too but don see how couldve made him should hit him back though well ,1
and hasn been playing basketball all that long comparatively understand you gripe but his measurables are just much better than anything ever seen only need achieve certain threshold skill one the best ever and you may not like don particularly like admitting but already quickly approaching that threshold ,1
chemistry issue sharing the ball usage rate this ha been the narrative since day even before the rus trade happened the medium love this narrative because incites reaction ,1
sorry post overlooked this bit what wa trying get houston fan are probably more upset this than your average mvp snub for those above reason but yes wa the better and more valuable player last year ,1
they clearly not watch rocket game can speak for any other team watched all but game last year and wa clear that the analyst never saw full rocket game ,1
just saying that why people are more upset than when russell curry won over him for the top all time you can just look shaquille neals career arc for precedent when you are that much bigger faster and stronger than guy you are assured certain floor for success probably top all time player but giannis way more skilled than shaq could ever hope being right now and probably just about over half way through developing ,1
total scrub ,1
lol never understood why you rocket fan get sensitive debatable topic that exactly why had clarify the start this sub because fan basketball and like browse around sub and see what the conversation this sub far the worst noticed that you don dickride harden every post you will downvoted there variety here just harden good giannis bad every other post ,1
heard jordan shot free throw once smh literally ruined the game ,1
damn look like gordon also ridiculously efficient catch shoot guy too ,1
how many people can share dallas and interested well ,1
yes and they almost unanimously have accepted standard best offensive player the best team with qualifier that the best player should significantly better than his teammate and not then second third best team acceptable lieu the top team that criterion ha been standardized for over year with only one potential blip ,1
you know why it the worst because it rocket sub for rocket fan you dont like kick rock ,1
pretty awful tbh wouldn want them team ever ,1
for the past two year been suspecting the same thing due how the medium discus the rocket especially harden and how far that from what actually going ,1
,1
fuck thought wa friday night ,1
that why wanted share the psa lol ,1
wtf wiggins these day lol soon typed that realized doe have great game against for some reason lol ,1
lmao everyone saying there just one ball ,1
mvp ,1
lakers literally had post about someone having shirt mwp elbowing harden and got thousand upvotes guess what fan like their player than other player and will ride die with them ,1
really cool graphic ,1
right don disagree with that point how can you blame the voting criterion but not the voter when the voter are the voting criterion the voting criterion wa not set the voter then that would make sense but the voting criterion the voter have defined fkn lame that doesn mean the voter should get pas imo they created ,1
can someone explain what exactly this saying ,1
soon harden becomes front runner for mvp the medium look for excuse not give him ,1
westbrook never had handle like that just explosive attacker but never fancy with the ball ,1
honestly can wait until play you guy three the most explosive player the league the court the same time that amazing plus want see how our defense will react rus and how you guy will work around offense truly excited ,1
it rocket sub shit people are gonna dickride harden just like hwo you get banned lakers for saying kobe overrated not top fuck outta here with the this sub the worst back nba you want civil discussion ,1
when opposing coach say hope issue you know not issue ,1
all the talent the world can make for lack discipline and work ethic worked becoming the best player could one the league brightest young star ,1
most the voter were still school when the voting criterion wa created they are perpetuating true but tradition bitch and honest wa precisely because team strength wa not being given enough weight the process that medium wa given the job voting the first place they are almost required consider team success the primary determiner and not blown away statistically historic season ,1
shot pocket the spot where you start your jumper from ,1
that dickrider mentality you like every single thing about harden just because play for the rocket harden said animal abuse wa cool you would probably agree with him wouldn you because rocket sub and you have too right ,1
kick rock hoe ,1
who the new favorite land the other way spot next ,1
because harden wa robbed historic number ,1
damn doe still give you the option buy the shoe you create here ,1
may have thought wa gonna win the championship that year with took bet himself sure thought last year the only reason didn win cause didn play ,1
you get them for free once you create them ,1
down split this well ,1
sorry meant buying the design and getting shipped your house real shoe think saw something ,1
man wish wearing these everyday ,1
too soon tell but blossomgame wa pretty impressive against the shark and need more forward ,1
nbastreamlinks twitter after they shut down nbastreams ,1
look amazing how long did take ship just ordered one from rocketsshop com http rocketsshop com ,1
maybe terrance jones return ryno and gary clark looked pretty forgettable the other night still need real rotation player the maybe that end being thabo and morey okay with that but truthfully that still leaf vulnerable the board ,1
look amazing how long did take ship just ordered one from rocketsshop com http rocketsshop com ,1
wa this game getting hyped enemy territory lowry and brook led victory this game ,1
really excited for this the rocket can still play their style basketball and also constantly have russell westbrook their disposal switch thing and demolish team rapid change pace ,1
downvoted cuz you just don get ,1
noo cooo nbj kzdxz ,1
people arent talking about the buck much but not sleepin you guy you were the best team last year ,1
surprised everyone talking about giannis leaving which know won know one talking about the team whole though ,1
well hasn said that and great basketball player lucky ,1
who here said giannis didn have good season and wasn just shitposting top that how doe saying harden had better one equate hate ,1
can anyone tell what shirt harden wearing that blue cross the back ,1
nene not the rotation ,1
least ben can shoot the rock ,1
thabo being not that big deal remember that tucker all need from thabo spit shoot and play defense also wa thinking the other way around give the old guy some serious load management during the regular season and ramp for them the playoff unless some the younger guy proved they deserve higher the pecking order ,1
not downer but doesn this really just mean attempted ton more than others slightly higher than average rate being himself doesn necessarily mean elite this measure elite but this just mean took lot more shot ,1
jesus christ you annoying hell man total lack self awareness ,1
love old dude but hope hartenstein and clark represents for the young squad ,1
use youtube still need vpn ,1
lmfao guess right then braindead fan like you are the reason why harden get much hate ,1
mean not ridiculously efficient but show how much carrying did last year not great efficiency but measuring greatness team carrying capacity far the best the league ,1
playoff are actually exactly when these vet will called upon contribute young guy will fill regular season minute but depending upon thabo and tyson for quality mpg come playoff time unless young guy ha breakout year ,1
see what you talking about thx ,1
chandler should good then bcs he already one chip he old but smart ,1
yeah lol with both all not really particularly flattering image for harden compared lot thing posted here but doe show how much needed keep the team contention last year ,1
yeah lol didn even know wa still the team ,1
dmorey thanks for being the best the league give dante cunningham year old with wingspan http youtu sjrlu ,1
dmo time ,1
man what the fuck feel terrible for this dude ,1
damn wa just about post this ,1
nike adidas as kicking ,1
when thing get hairy mdt going with man rotation anyway ,1
when your girl start thinking she can roast you ,1
dude wtf didn know they shut down ,1
giannis not closer top all time than harden you have fool believe that ha had literally dominant season whereas harden ha now had mvp caliber season his last year ,1
sacrificed hustled paid the price ,1
yeah pretty sad lol ,1
didn say that said giannis will top all time this doesn mean harden won giannis path top much clearer than harden however just ha play ball and win chip harden ha the same but rely shot that until year ago wa very inefficient and rely rule exploitation ,1
westbrook isn playing the first couple game ,1
dude tucker with his little purse can deal with ,1
wish they would release hardens normal color way like this ,1
yup wear that look like idiot but doe look fresh guess just don have the sauce ,1
background somewhere houston where just curious where these guy shop lol ,1
they hawaii ,1
they hawaii ,1
ohh yea nvm ,1
same ppl who said wa ridiculous bring ,1
practicing kicking that as ,1
pre season right ,1
how giannis path much easier just ha play ball like harden ha been doing already for year claiming that harden ha rely rule exploitation tell all need know about your understanding the game and yeah inefficient shot for most anyone except harden that what make great seriously your argument like saying steph curry relied deep three during his unanimous mvp year which wa inefficient shot yeah shit because really fucking good and better than anyone else giannis meanwhile ha had great season and unlikely come out the east any time soon somehow lock for chip lmao ,1
not stupid enough other sub and complain you must lonely trolling people online get job something homie ,1
tension the locker room ,1
virgin east chad west ,1
need this get the video meme production ,1
not shade the rocket mean she cheating him lmaoooo ,1
someone put this shit nba ,1
except lately they been arguing that wa one the most immovable contract the league questioning his heart and dedication and there have been lot negative comment made about him since the trade became official been top player the league and still very serviceable point guard imply that only deserves minimum insult they wrote him that contract because wouldn take anything le time all star that wa still averaging the season before came houston that still one the best playmaker the league ,1
and scola inadvertently hurt the great zhou god love this team now with lightening harden god load ,1
think harden basically averaged the same amount point against the shanghai shark did the rest the entire season against the best player earth ,1
sad make sad miss you chris ,1
tried but kept removing smh ,1
what you work news paper company something ,1
hate that guy but one saying that they aren friendly off the court this game literally showed nothing how they will play together because you know they didn play together ,1
dank accomplished ,1
had busy summer but always have time for the dank ,1
you being purposefully obtuse you can see how saying that can wait into the post season with real killer after going into the post season with the past two year straight saying that chris isn real killer despite averaging his first year the playoff with the rocket and the next with two steal along with each year the dog part talking about determination which mean think chris didn really try hard enough and the killer part obviously saying that doesn think chris about dominate game which pretty ridiculous with some the statlines ha put you just stupid you can see that acting professionally while there ha been lot shade thrown his way don know about before the trade but there doubt any longer that harden helped facilitate the trade for rus definitely the reason gone saying otherwise ridiculous never said wa forcing him out before the trade because thought everything wa overblown but every comment about obtaining rus ha either been ill worded they intentionally wording them effort put blame chris stop trying put twist the insult that harden and tilman have aimed chris everybody ha fault but that doesn mean they need shunt blame for the last two season paul http thunderousintentions com okc thunder chris paul james harden fertitta shade amp ,1
wa def fun great game see ,1
clemons def top fav rocket ,1
damn you hate see ,1
hey shut guy ,1
why are you booing right ,1
they never played together yeah ,1
chief this isnt ,1
would personally take chris over anthony bennett would have for each position and someone get injured can step ,1
doesn dunk frequently anymore nice see that ,1
dank you back ,1
either they didn think their shit they which really stupid interview they did this purpose which dick move ,1
yes because harden wa this good back then cmon bro you know that the time okc don mean shit anymore they are very different player than they were back then god damn all are really sensitive about rus and harden huh ,1

need more chris clemons ,1
love pickle but really doesn with their sandwich especially the one they use ,1
bro that love patch big ,1
how can make this gif ,1
yeah there only screen they cant share screentime ,1
again you are reading into too much real killer not westbrook real killer unlike literally blatantly just saying westbrook real killer man excited play with him your looking for shade throw and your moron you are blatantly wrong and blatantly anti harden trying make some bullshit comment that have literally nothing with fucking your such fanboy the okc sub that where now have nothing but love for but you fanboys are annoying because your mad got traded stop with the idiot ,1
love that not gonna change yall remember rondo spitgate always had his back then that footage came out shit wa crazy ,1

ofcourse wearing them orlando gotta rub their face haha ,1
why doe look like snot coming out ,1
wtf did those chicago asshats change whataburger packaging seriously tho can wrong with cfa ,1
retire his number sure wa only season but wa the best season since the mid and would have won the chip his leg wasn hurt the end the wcf and that not his fault just happened love chris ,1
nunnally used play for the rocket right kind ,1
rus channelled himself into harden and got triple double from bench remotely ,1
this wa such good game embiid dunked westbrook which made him furious and wa just throwing down whenever wa near the rim and made like the straight win against philly ,1
shame that harden too good able make harden and westbrook work anymore ,1
who talking about them playing together fun guy ,1
that man ha family ,1
noticed lot point shot fake that turned out pass wonder antoni incorporated that keep the opponent defense honest loved seeing though seems like might adding some new offensive scheme and stuff this year ,1
seat sooo empty wish not mile away ,1
said after the playoff last year that wouldn doing one after every game due the fact that they require much work sure see plenty link previous video though ,1
totally understand that maybe someone group that split game will come with something new either way last year wa glorious and will not forgotten tint ,1
just got this same combo myself great taste ,1
lol dude got tape worm ,1
houston rocket shanghai shark watch now http greyboxmovie com houston rocket shanghai shark watch now http greyboxmovie com houston rocket shanghai shark watch now http greyboxmovie com houston rocket shanghai shark watch now http greyboxmovie com ,1
feel bad but it his fault changed the rule could get paid more year and more money signed max and then underperformed have idea how got rid his contract tbh ,1
class ,1
laker fan coming here say watched the highlight and even tho wa against the shark that boy gerald green looked like stud clemons also impressed ,1
way ruin your career smh ,1
rude double the other team ,1
can wait for you incorporate this into the postgame win clip this coming season haha ,1
when they get utah the first round year row ,1
with rocket fan clearly she upgrading ,1
jokic and kat and gobert are going keep clint out the asg his entire career but yeah look better when healthy ,1
ugh what toxic and divisive locker room these guy must have even during pregame they already trying establish that they are the alpha dancer and not the other ,1
goosebump ,1
didn feel bad when point per game eric gordon got shipped off new orleans blake and deandre could form lob city wa the worst year eric professional career then eric finally escape year later and chooses sign with houston then year later who force there way houston getting half the damn team traded that who imagine how trez lou bev and decker felt leaving the mvp play crusty chris could get one final shot ring let not forget the reason chris gone because harden wanted rus but also wa burned out chris sorry bury your boy but couldn stay healthy when needed him the playoff year ago and played like as ball hogged for stats this past playoff rus the other hand known for his loyalty and will help bring title this team unlike chris could ,1
always son kat and gobert tho the playoff and nugget don know how beat something like ,1
getting paid about mil for month easy work think fine ,1
tnt ,1
time clap ,1
his ambition fat paycheck then sure not going starve ,1
well wasn going the next tim duncan what else you play for love the game and money ,1
man had suppressed those memory had great first pre season game too shit ,1
chief repeat this ain there are okc fan that love westbrook but thought needed trade him not for particular but just reset just don get how you guy read everything negatively the biggest characteristic rus much more than his motor his fire just because harden say he ready war with dog something half the league would say ha bearing just hyping teammate this ain ,1
yep armstrong can hell ,1
wow player superstar good player good with potential they play well player superstar player superstar superstar league apparently they play worse ,1
literally say you excited the playoff with someone that dog killer one hundred percent implication that you were not previously with someone like that never said you don the trade course you rus trade available make sense the bullshit taking shot player that almost put you over the top for championship that only did classy thing for your team and your city that the bullshit ,1
rocket fan are much fun lmao ,1
king fan first ben mclemore fan second how did play today see that got pt which wild for see but did look effective the floor watching lot rocket game co him and will rooting for you guy the side ,1

rocketscast live red ,1
but know his right ,1
imo number game there just aren enough guard minute for him you not going take the ball out james rus eric austin hand let clemons run the offense rather stock wing forward depth than guard that ,1
thanks give shot ,1
love some whataburger after breaking whata cherry last year ,1
kelly iko will probably have new one soon been asking for name idea twitter recently ,1
the meme this year are gonna mvp ,1
score then score more ,1
always good against the nugget because jokic too slow guard capela ,1
haven heard that name before this good thing ,1
green and clemons can have bout instant offense during the season overly hyped for this guy ,1
one expected draft the third all time leading scorer ncaa history guess don need draft pick then ,1
iko cover the rocket for the athletic really good ,1
all know with iko ,1
nice heard the athletic pretty good give him shot when air ,1
solid beat reporter and ha really good relationship with player and morey ,1
thanks didn know decided one yet ,1
sick this victim culture where everyone need constantly offended ,1
hate you being that guy too ,1
that wa suggestion pas you like ,1
don think eligible for way you have have year le the nba not sure bennett season where spent half his time the gleague and other half the nba count nba season but imagine they ,1
that how you respond everything that negative critique that you don have rationally argue against your posted facebook month after all broke about how she wa glad finally with intelligent career oriented attractive man and you don think aimed you then you stupid same thing applies here that how that work something replaced and you make statement about the replacement direct comparison you can talk about your new washer being able fit all your clothes the same load your last washer wa already able that therefore you replace your number two option and talk about how nice have good player for once insult the player being replaced and opinion and insult your current teammate but that part debatable ,1
not yet but wa very impressed clemons bbiq lot drive and kick well good sight the open man austin fit better atm because not eager shoot and because especially pestering defense ,1
hawaii ,1
comment far the international card issue but question are you buying resale imagine resale ticket will more accommodating international card there several different resale sight shop also recommend waiting till you are here buy the ticket like day few day before price will typically lower and always been able find seat even big name game ,1
the only available one available for game jan feb right now are resale the different site seem redirected back through ax whoever the ticket sale are done through which seems have the card issue planned watch the game against the nugget the jan just might have wait till are stateside then ,1
treybuchet ,1
surprised resale site aren letting you buy wonder using your ip location deny buying measure avoid international scalping but thats just guessing hope work out when you are stateside worst case you have friend locally you could ask them buy for you then transfer them you and you pay them back ,1
hawaii time which hour behind cst hometown ,1
the ,1
you leaving out his injury history which really hurt the rocket had all cerebrally but couldn stay the court and lot time could not beat his man the iso heavy offense the signing the contract believed wa either too long and too expensive annually they shouldn have given him the max all front ,1
lol nice threw ton suggestion out there that thought were good glad know got down guess recycle them for next time someone getting together new rocket podcast lol ,1
the athletic great occasionally share article that think are interesting but can share all the insightful clip and such that love well ,1
ben looked really solid tbh hoping can see some minute from him the regular season ,1
doesn deserve minimum got contract deserves him taking minimum would cap favor his contract wa hard move contract just like westbrook not just how good the player isn perceived the contract itself doe matter that regard even contract like harden hard move contract team would have gut itself make trade like that and couldn take short changed contract because wa the midst making point for the player because star taking le then they are worth wa being issue and the have beeb fighting against being necessary don know personally would have taken smaller deal they could have still got rus and there wa pressure from the public but did get contract deserved but came with other repercussion and his heart and dedication ha not been questioned anyone houston and haven heard that the medium either his age and body breaking down have been the only real concern about and then people the medium overblown his demeanor negative way everyone involved still seems maintain that ha nothing with harden reportedly wanted rus his team for year before even got there that didn have anything with either considering also wanted there too really believe the cap wa unlimited and they could make move while paying everyone they would absolutely love have still the rocket they would have probably had trade eric gordon that were the case though just get the rus trade approved ,1
injury among good player are common lately and very rarely considered when contact time come kyrie blake wall boogie and more chris paul historically impactful sucked for houston when got injured and can understand trading him the only thing think poor reflection the rocket are these comment that are almost certainly worded throw shade him good player and been good the community just respectful after the trade guy that hasn said bad thing about the team ,1
that make sense ,1
runner mvp level ,1
wait until they get japan lol ,1
preseason and monday not too surprising ,1
the unfortunate reality front court just loaded ayton king bigs etc ,1
look some the comment this thread minority but still there biggest issue the comment harden made about going the playoff with roughly condensed determined and good player and the owner talking about how rus and harden will act like brother instead one player acting like mentor the subtle and not subtle shade being thrown into the public arena just kind crappy especially when all aimed chris currently think the trade wa good one for the rocket and ultimately should been done but don throw shit the guy you traded you send him packing ,1
welcome the life nba fan the lol ,1
okay never saw him say that give break guy ,1
before you out hill for over harden remember wouldn have stepped one foot houston didn give him the most money possible ,1
try flash seat website for rocket season ticket holder resell their seat http rocket flashseats com ,1
understandable comment wa strictly concerning his level play and injury history the signing his current contract his first year houston wa amazing and believe passed some great habit harden like improving his leadership and helping with his turnover intangible are only worth much salary capped league though ,1
westbrook and harden would sit the back together lmao ,1
harden would leave you didn give him max too player try get what they think they deserve imagine trying lure top player and offering le than how much they guaranteed get elsewhere and expecting them come not conducive luring good player ,1
good luck ,1
but you still offended professional athlete behalf which just weird considering the guy making per day just for breathing sure won shed tear for you ,1
rip ,1
that argument hold water either should shrug off athlete get killed because they make more money than should show some basic human compassion and feel bad for them this almost make much sense the people telling the basketball player shut and dribble instead caring about basic civil right someone circumstance doesn make them undeserving sympathy support especially when that individual ha probably helped more people with his money than will ever able ,1
sorry now realize comment came off harsh just seems like every thread get bombarded people saying make video ,1
fair argument ,1
pat bev course favorite player who wa never rocket though say kawhi don love the manner which left san antonio but his defense and the way put the work into turning himself into mvp level way player just amazing ,1
guess count now ,1
like the king backcourt ,1

aaron fox ,1
mitchell probably ,1
kawhi ,1
aaron fox devin booker little bit aaron gordon too ,1
think need guard especially our position very weak ,1
river can play the well and with probably playing lot there will minute available ,1

this new year player safe when one man combined with the power analytical analysis will take prisoner everyone the market trade deadline rated ,1
same and same parent actually pulled out after grade ,1
lol never lived houston ever moved nyc and now orange county after college always been where there traffic and cost living sky high always visited houston for the rocket whether wa swinging training old firm were national just making long layover there way the east coast grown love the rocket and houstonians but just not enough move there lol ,1
found wa common feeling from the few people keep touch with wa there all the way through graduated just before there wa high school ,1
might residual benefit learning from the point gawd who notoriously ha shot pocket donovan mitchell mentioned podcast episode that literally ha shot pocket seems like harden worked some that into his repertoire just speculating course and that slow motion gather throw you wayyy off wouldn know what think were front him ,1
everybody playing mario kart tour ,1

need the mvp and the jersey are nice touch and smart way get around any issue ,1
starter ,1
but will ,1
seems that the son were raised the and were previously all about soccer only after olajuwon felt they should give basketball serious attempt did move them back here the eldest already probably fairly behind other kid who are seriously learning idk enough about but that young enough still advance enough compete against others the elite level ,1
you can but doesn really bother all that much plus can take upholstery shop and have removed ever feel the need pretty sure the only way preorder wa from rocketsshop com and any official team site always ha the patch them ,1
that first one ,1
you right that big for both ryno and hartenstein there literally nothing else for hartenstein prove the league besides shore bbiq but will never make the leap stay with inferior competition won league final mvp and put absurd number both end the floor while consistently knocking down pointer him making leap would depend opportunity such last year when were super limited that had guard early regular season game and showed glimpse how valuable could being defensively attuned the switching scheme and giving some resistance the perimeter however fell out the rotation and spent way too much time away effective when wa asked come back the end the league season this season now never for him the rocket and would probably better another team with opportunity rather than contender doesn immediately contribute ryno feel good gamble you love see him turn back the clock but didn look great after falling out the starting line with the sun early last season and then completely out rotation with the heat that just didn have need for him ,1
all these made three and can make single damn open three with him ,1
yeah seen him nice you think could become jamal crawford type player ,1
you happen know what podcast ,1
hakeem didn start playing until wa you could say there precedent ,1
always lean the side fuck seems legit whenever see harden move were ref ,1
murray and lavine aren counting people who have played for the rocket ,1

hey sorry wasn notified had message but yeah stoked too ,1
definitely too ,1
yeah must have sucked grow rich lol grateful for what you had lot worse school houston you could have gone ,1
seen that around the world step back for lack better term where brings the ball around his back few video now bet see that live real soon ,1
none them are traveling guess people don understand the concept sarcasm got downvoted ,1
looove some book dude beast ,1
mean willing send him unlabeled with content sourced from the high sea that wa the only issue ,1
piggybacking off this basically the zero step gather like danbobway said allows him get free step because hasn fully gained control the ball yet ,1
when year old max shouldn surprised that they traded him either business not you can have both way ,1
ha lot quality over rus but the dog aspect the one where lose rus everyday again simply player hyping new member the team green said similar you see the trade business transaction rather than something personal doe not look personal ,1
that last shot wa super big brain watched the highlight from the other night and thought everyone wa throwing weird lob pass that looked like shot but then you see this and now harden putting shot the look like lob wft going ,1
his step back wa literally already not guardable the only way you could stop wa give him the lane now shooting step back faster off one foot jesus ,1
never said there weren very grateful for opportunity and education all saying didn have enjoyable experience ,1
got some pointer from the professor and street baller not long ago ,1
when saw sefolosha make that shot looking pas thought why dont more player this they always pas from side side laterally why not from above like shot ,1
man he good too ,1
clearly still need replace the ariza luc role more competently aside from our actual rotation forward cover minute game consists unproven youth house clark hartenstein and vet min signing thabo ryno bennett running guard lineup didn work against the dub buck last year need size get board and defend big contender like and philly again are entering the season hoping that least those value option forward pop ,1
wait did china copy our color scheme ,1
formatting tip you aren fan crazy letter then you should least put all that quote text people know they are not your word ,1
did you get good education genuinely curious ,1
that sexy hell just wish they wouldn slap the hideous even the nike logo ,1
walked when they were getting ready for that pic lot chinese rocket fan attendance like the respect the rocket gave the shark too played the chinese national anthem before the game ,1
yeah you right lol always just tend relax being grammatically correct outside school job interview ,1
you guy think could snatch custom throwback with name could just find one with olajuwon the back ,1

lol upvoted you but took second for digest the parenthesis hardly saw framed that way anyways good take lol ,1
dame dolla ,1
bro his thigh are scrumptious not gay but wa totally thigh guy ,1
harden take really good run some the people the dream shake they always great job and they fun listen ,1
thank you ,1
our ultra small ball lineup harden paul river gordon tucker wa statistically the best lineup had against the warrior ,1
mitchell and ness ha the olajuwon have both the mustard ketchup and the white throwback they both sure they allow fan including buck fan lol custom them after the initial sale which point looking forward putting name them ,1
locked rocket red nation hoop harden take the dream shake clutchfans red rocketscast live locked the only one that come out frequently the rest have been coming out maybe once month but that might due the off season sure they releasing more podcasts during the season there also podcast that alykhan bijani and kelly iko are doing the athletic but you have pay for subscription cheap though only month right now plus there free trial period month for you don like you can just cancel ,1
poor stuck okc til get buyout ,1
dude had as bricking jumper for damn drill ,1
and could play lineup that didn get destroyed when that lineup our top player large margin only missing clunt who wa horrible the wcsf wasn the floor then have probably won ,1
sure had more talent than the greatest roster ever assembled nba history would done better ,1
yaaaaaaaaaaayyaaaa ,1
sure that would have worked too but just asking for someone better than shumpert that could probably have been enough too and lot easier accomplish ,1
first one looked like clear travel until slowed down sheeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitt ,1
wouldn know what think were guarding him either but mostly because suck basketball and didn make past middle school team ,1
next thing you know they fuck with hong kong and start harvesting the organ opponent ,1
really only like clutchfans and lockedon rocket feel like the guy harden take are tad annoying cringey ,1
doubt all the chinese are like that ,1
when did morey turn into dime piece ,1
man almost feel for this dude then remember that salary cap hit ,1
aren buying him out best and most likely case scenario that performs well and ha overachieving early and then some upstart like minnesota miami want continue their surprising success and trade for him ,1
hey doe the new red one have the whole side panel black thinner strip black ,1
definitely want collect some throwback from couple team once release our purple throwback and the raptor too gonna try grab all three ,1
drippin not slippin ,1
that game such bullshit ,1

great scorer awesome the big once retires with ring ,1
kanye still hasn dropped his album yet but rocket basketball back baby ,1
pumped been long off season ,1
think mclemore make the roster over bennett with ryno coming back make anthony redundant have the roster for stretch especially when ryno more proven the league ,1
ohhhhh lord ,1
hartenstein ha huge benefit going for him that half his contract ha already been guaranteed iirc the rocket are trying duck the tax again narrator they are then that kind money make difference edit besides remember that nen almost certainly gone the trade deadline may well need hart for that center spot ,1

don call this the westbrook era this and ha been and will the harden era when dream led the team success and then they added drex one called the drexler era and rightfully thunder fan need chill ,1
lol relax rocket fan adding westbrook significant ofc the harden era but they not mutually exclusive saying are the westbrook era right now isn negating being the all encompassing harden era the rocket ,1
dude happy asf for real going scary hush hush air bnb ,1

gameday september holy fuck ,1
sorry sold them hope you find other cheap ticket ,1
those jersey ,1
pjt those are the guy that have decent chunk guaranteed money coming their way suspect they make the roster ryno also ha guarantee giving him inside track spot only great from bennett kick him out imo that leaf only one spot left one bennett mclemore frazier pond blossingame clemons make get way and rgv realistically fit experience guess mclemore will get the spot show can rooting for clemons and bennett make our way contract but mainly cause know nothing valuable about anyone else ,1

dfa house ,1
glad back with you guy these past couple month have been kind hard for ,1
harden chasing minute triple double ,1
,1
these next few month boutta amazing ,1
james looking sharp ,1
interesting point want bounce back from last year went from vet team all young team that didn have identity glad back with team that ha goal and familiar with that this group that mean what lack that what felt like few year ago this year there excitement the air say his job and lot other guy job space the floor and let harden and rus their thing not fan this tyson add more than what you see and off the court great leader and veteran ha knack for offensive rebounding with tapbacks say his journey ha been one many mental struggle ups and down you know story you know there been challenge last year wa challenge never experienced before but doesn wanna complain say he learned from and feel fortunate where have chance play for houston again conversation about joining began happening month ago with dantoni and then heated with morey recently response question about not having that huge contract anymore say it tough being guy making lot money and not playing and getting lot minute say wa frustration and definitely big ego trip and got talked alot the medium say now pressure off and can enjoy the game again and great teammate and the player they want him hope doesn forget his deadly pump fake and sneaky post move ,1
rus shot alright after the allstar break last year wouldn surprised shot the year wa after the break also shot from when catch and shoot opposed pull ups rus also start slow when shooting usually facilitates lot early then get his rhythm late game quarter last year after the asb started hurt the man shot from the field and from catch and shoot when open all know isn shooter but the sometimes really doe look like that plus the system and dont know you ever heard james harden you guy are going fucking good next year ,1
also surprised the ball the reporter straight ask ryno question about his contract lol ,1
getting pointer point per possession which actually better than most half court offense there reason the rocket jack many ,1
pretty sure resulted massive momentum swing too can remember the exact circumstance but pretty sure the thunder were only down little bit the time and wa late the game and then the eventual play ran out timeout wa terrible ,1
think rus will play off the ball really well but this drill doesn prove that the slightest ,1
dmo cant even play the nba anymore ryno the absolute best floor spacing the league when ha someone who can get him open look dude take from foot behind the arc shut as ,1
he really one favorite role player love his attitude cant blame him for taking that big as fuckin check wa made joke for but he still got the shooting ability people say shit about last yesr but only played like game and took le than game had him shoot wide open shot from harden attempt and he gonna bigly this year ,1
happy back sure not perfect but what good really good plus know not known for his rebounding because usually the perimeter but between him capela chandler tucker and rus the rocket rebounding number are going crazy ,1
you say even you dont have clue atleast have good night ,1
second le ,1
tbh long time rus fan never seen him set screen with his full body like that always lazy half screen anything nothing else prof can get set into actual screen position when asked and also that might the type action the rocket run this season ,1
donovan hasn even gotten extension though the team just picked the option the final year his contract because they would rather have him lead the tank then have pay for new coach ,1
looking like sexy rex fucking love ,1
lol chime thunder fan yes think should just play out the contract don renew and find another coach the end the contract ,1
he with the homies and they all actually have personality ,1
which player and what happened like the kong bunch and enjoy watching them when can but don really keep with news like this his firing definitely seemed come out nowhere ,1
talking about morey apologist when team are looking aren about hoop him and shanghai lol ,1
that make the most sense you know what you paying donovan but you don know you and you don want spend that much what other coach will want come while the team isn likely top ten seed the west just enjoy the tank for year and happy you will have shot better coach develop the solid young guy you have and the one you will draft with all those pick from the clipper and rocket well whatever you might get trade for ,1
exactly everyone win now mode the west point investing anything other than year from now ,1
spelled bawl and don worry these night will get easier ,1
excellent summary distilled all the essential hope can reassert himself contributor and build back his value and help get the one goal that matter from basketball perspective ,1
three brick haha ,1
none went tho ,1
damn river ha some clean fucking ink ,1
rus and harden supposed ha zero ink ,1
there few duo and trio you could say this about all around the nba ,1
nsfw ,1
yeah would you happen know why have they spoke that before not saying bad thing just odd ,1
what ,1
what great guy ,1
what else ,1
know for sure had issue with buddy hield ,1
username check out ,1
fair enough brother ,1
damn this that chronic right here ,1
dude he just trying start discussion what your opinion moving forward would for them you dont gotta dick ,1
making lowry run for his money ,1
lookin like hungry lmao ,1
okc think black pepper spicy ,1
tyson chandler looking like ready risk all the background lol ,1
one the first thing said rocket were nice guy this expected ,1
you can never have too much shooting when some guy are off other guy are ,1
brick tho ,1
apology ,1
you too brother ,1
signing green house river trading for rus reaching agreement with gordon contract extension locking core over long haul adding quality vet like sefolosha chandler bringing back ryno who familiar with the system morey ha done great job ,1
shut ,1
the pendulum swing both way ,1
shut fat boy ,1
okc fan here and iirc rus ha said that not going get any ink until win title idk about harden ,1
billy good developing young player not then you are losing more than just year game ,1
legend ha harden ha ink under the beard fact the whole beard massive tattoo ,1
rus took another and made the last second the video ,1
yep but variance bitch ,1
dude thought wa nba wa confused cuz you have cartoon dude for flair ,1
harden wa playing good defense ,1
rus look happy all these clip ,1
found bobbythegreat ,1
having the triple double quoted the rocket sub and upvoted that truly the best timeline ,1
this team ha much personality all the guy seem funny hard working and selfless fucking love ,1
get ready for lot wide open missed three ,1
brick city usa ,1
you hate see someone like stephen adam stuck that roster too such good ,1
think did pretty good developing player florida ,1
nothing but thong all star break you heard here first ,1
also such momentum player can imagine him not getting touch for minute then knocking down when struggling with even his free throw not going find that bread and butter elbow jumper much the rocket offense and those adam screen are long gone ,1
did make horford and noah good did they make him good ,1
very solid head coach nevermind assistant coach would great pickup ,1
mean there wa also beal brewer parson don know how much stock you can put donovan helping them but certainly ha experience with developing young player ,1
too true ,1
wa the far end play one where the rocket were actually practicing skipping open basket layup pas out ,1
you not fan role player knowing their playing with two prime time former mvp what you want ryno setting tucker lol ,1
really need see him this headband during live play ,1
presti playing the long game ,1
probably the same people that stopped prime westbrook and prime paul george ,1
ha dmo fired armstrong yet dude burned all bridge ,1
not even the same planet harden ,1
wouldn say that wa prime rus and love rus with all heart ,1
terry rozier and cody zeller ,1
they weren going ,1
password beardxbrodie ,1
great beard stick together ,1
think this happens every off season with rus looked good last summer ,1
think play much cuz tyson most like steven adam and rus loved steve them screen and rebound ,1
shit let change ,1
lmao your comment not his prime the dude like mentally probably and then you say not his prime how you talk girl with skill set like this seems fascinating ,1
too wa confused that part ,1
that the beauty basketball and having depth you can just sub guy out for another guy relatively quickly ,1
man baron davis wa one the most fun player ever watch that series had against the seed maverick wa legendary ,1
rocket are stacked and have top roster the league they have figure out money done literally everything but trade for iguodala ,1
wish brought back faried and ben macklemore underrated pick ,1
lol wa sorta cringing these other dude towards the end the video both them just awkward hell ,1
beautiful love this team much ,1
yeah used crazy thunder ,1

people just don realize happy guy general ,1

this fantastic rus being james head looking through his eye same vision one goal ,1
that one legged jumper hardem would went wasn for the other ball ,1
when threw his head tie harden mark lmao nba going use that clip evidence rocket discord lol ,1
capela and adam are almost exactly the same player and are le injury prone and likely able play more minute night night basis ,1
and aware that hence the whole keep the bad coach and tank for year before hiring good coach because you don want pay donovan and whoever you bring coach ,1
not saying youre wrong but this the thing let look rus mvp first first off really ha never been done came off season where top player left for nothing sign and trade nothing and they still got win and the seed all because him and did average triple double which nobody ha ever done dont like comparing oscar because the compeition wa much much worse back then le team top that rus did with little shooting around him etc wa something unprecendented people thing with scoring defense etc but just thought rus revolutionized with that season you also have look the narrative added leaf then people feel bad for rus add him winning the mvp not saying thats the reason but add now let compare james yes the scoring scoring but did astronomical rate carried willed whatever wa that spectacular and this day still dont know why didnt win the mvp wa more deserved over what giannis did james had better record compared kobe season more ppg more apg more rpg and yes believe kobe deserved mvp that year also but again it like this people vote for narrative long with somebody doing the unseen people get used scoring they factor what happens average triple double now nash mvp wa similar giannis where the team had win likeable non polarizing superstar and with amare the whole season wa very impressive well look the tripld double like this rus ha averaged for the past season well but this past season for instance wa all nba third team instead second for instance why that it because people get used stuff like this top that james had just won his mvp the voter may have felt swing this likeable superstar giannis led the buck win play all world defense and isnt polarizing player watch unlike james let give him thats how voter view thing and dont like seeing like that mvp mean most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically defeintly see that more with james opposed steph see that greatly with rus see that greatly with james well ,1
gerald made the cut this beauty love the team much from the first those borderline the cut ,1
think pretty interesting title ,1

tweet http twitter com salmanalinba status and article clint capela car vandalized couple day after playoff loss http www msn com sport nba rocket clint capelas car vandalized day after playoff loss aadldwh ,1
optimistic for sure but haven seen single game yet ,1
mean wa worth the price when signed originally just kinda fell off bit over the year wa basically the top his specialized role for minute mean stretch ryno skillset and his ability keep his defender far away from the paint wa really valuable asset the time ,1
thats how voter view thing and dont like seeing like that yeah but again voter have consistantly voted guy like giannas top team conference but lesser stats over guy like harden pretty consistently the history the nba would one thing the consensus historically wa vote for the westbrook esque season great stats but team success but been the opposite mvp mean most valuable player meaning you take that player off said team they get worse dramatically again you look how people have voted the award historically just valid argument would that the mvp best player one the best team think the reason why people have that opinion because there this notion that yeah you can have season like westbrook did but then all knew that they didn realistically have shot winning title how valuable can you can you bring your team championship sense you are almost certainly getting knocked out the first round not saying that your opinion wrong any mean all just opinion and personally would fine with them more strictly defining the criterion and creating award that more centered just crazy regular season number but the nba probably intentionally ha made the criterion for the award vague because every year people like argue what they think the mvp mean and drive discussion the nba ,1
lemme see ab ,1
this dope put tshirt ,1
just got hit enough make team think might dangerous enough the corner can slash the hoop that where his real damage off the ball can done imo ,1
god this dope as team ,1
goodbye offseason you won missed ,1

lol not the best this hopefully deerontherocks occasionally incorporates some music for rus and harden don want get too away from tippin ,1
you got help you got help ben self narration cut but didn matter ,1
fuck that deep ,1
short short gang rise ,1
like sure that will for replay the rocket official website ,1
didn stand chance lol seeing player frantically guard harden close really put into perspective how good ,1
lot clip rus the corner think gonna run play make that his shot this year for context shot the most corner his career last year clip being set those harden expect that number rise ,1
such great scorer ben played great but when james ha tiny bit space that step back gem cant anything about that ,1
seriously how can people speculate how wa gone now just leave him alone dude wa one injury one game from taking the final don shit your own team player ,1
did shuffle his foot before putting the floor though ,1
love ,1
great see alignment historical statistic him with the rocket squeezing the most from him analytically going into this season ,1
can wait ,1
with the way you talk and your dumbass take swear all are autistic white dude fact the all might the same person ,1
more like the interview ryno say more than once his and other guy job just space the floor not fan our player who have multiple skillsets becoming dimensional floor spacing player our offense can benefit from everyone being driving threat rynos shown flash his first year here and slowly reduced his fga over his time here ,1
same but farieds best situational player like green and that bridge ha been burned awhile ago ,1

tweet http twitter com salmanalinba status ,1
ha been recent practice observing since ha good relationship with the assistant coach ,1
yoooooo someone with skill gotta make gif that part where hold the face picture and smile ded also hyped leggo rus ,1
didnt even guard the opposing guard best scorer the opposing team fact wa the third primary wing overall that guarded just from all the analytics rus ha been the better defender the past season plus his ball defense ha been better for while now due his footspeed athleticism overall hope he smart about the off ball issue though because thats where most star tend struggle and course offense there the shooting but otherwise it plus both end ,1
gordan really good defender guard tho and westbrook will help the rebounding theoretically plus they aren starting the year with melo and mcw who didn fit all ,1
auditioning incase extension le mda doesn make ,1
possibly might also taking note not everyday you get look directly behind the scene team like ours ,1
they signed uncle thabo well pretty sure ,1

give fuck the mavs and morey trust and you good ,1
that one scary dude ,1
that the bottom ,1
absolutely man welcome rocket nation baby ,1
youre right just stating opinion overall ha and always will the best record winning best overall stat player said team like wa lebron and rose lebron steph and james and giannis will have those anomaly year though which something different done rus and what should have been harden especially for instance let say random name doncic average while shooting and lead the mavs the seed whereas guy like jokic average and lead the nugget the seed voter might feel more inclined vote for doncic here nobody expects the mavs the playoff tbh let alone the seed top that average triple double and go for thats just what mean anomaly year ,1
rus shot from catch and shoot situation going great fit off ball with harden ball handling vice versa for harden who can also shoot high percentage off the same shot ,1
google translate argentinean veteran luis scola who the age ha shown outstanding performance the previous world cup and made his national team the final will spend the next season the olympics milan according eurohoops scola arrival milan wa first announced coach ettore mesina news conference after the defeat olimpia brescia few minute later the news wa posted his social network club sign scola for the season according statement scola agent the argentine wa also talk with boco junior and even real madrid given that olimpia milano also play the euroleague luis scola will return this competition for the first time since the season when played for basconia ,1

welcome aboard ,1
lol better sign that nda anti competitor restriction letter sure most you can figure out down the line but would nice add the staff especially since player love him plus mda getting older whether there extension not there light the end the tunnel not the morbid one but the retirement light also would wise participate and involved contender before seeking another position whether here elsewhere ,1
yeah and someone could get dhgate manufacture those mock ups like the other astro ish one that are out there ,1
ftm ftm ftm imwt imwt imwt oops sorry force habit ,1
welcome just time watch the launch and countdown ,1
kind think that when you have tucker playing the and with how good harden the switching scheme because his ability guard bigger player you are kind priced into the very least switching now maybe you make other exception for other player like find out westbrook better fighting through pick maybe don switch with him and the offensive end going even better because harden get switched onto defensively then they get stop and suddenly harden ha bad matchup him from the start transition going lead easy scoring opportunity the other end even more now that going running more will make far easier take advantage those mismatch that were initially created letting harden get switched onto big ,1
thanks for the new wallpaper ,1

westbrook river harden green mclemore gordon house sefolosha tucker clark anderson capela chandler nene hartenstein think hartenstein the only one that question mark here the last person ask about contract and roster availability and all those rule but think due contract and free agent signing all these young guy are gonna cut the league not sure how that work hopeful are clemons and kinda rooting for anthony bennett but our looking very good cause there not one guy don wanna see the court but unfortunately the rotation can only big very excited for the season ,1
think this would help harden the defensive end not having run around much which where get exposed ,1
his shot look dramatically better lol ,1
might the most clutch player the rocket ,1
great problem have for indeed huge difference from last season where all rationalized ourselves into many player including mcw and wing and the super hype around ennis ,1
idk about the part but having house and austin from the start going help ,1
how sad that rus couldn make the cut ,1
don know lot about contract could bennett sign two way ,1
will transfer over flash seat and will accept venmo paypal interested ,1
splooge indeed ,1

just getting know him instead hoping loses lol ,1
only after won championship wa darling ,1
many bleep that song but cant wait see harden rus highlight reel the unedited version ,1
dont think bad thing cry when you achieved something that great however harden doesnt care about mvp just wanted one want ring ,1

put money that will increase dramatically with rus and harden feeding him not like just forgot how shoot ,1
chris clemons that all ,1
got sinister feel this ,1
bout unzip pant right now ,1
mean could have said the same with harden and just lost his touch ,1
they the people who say and all said they couldn exist smh either way ridiculous ,1
fuck yeah ball out rus thunder for life but rocket for next year ,1
steph all time great all need respect ,1
cause those people are clown lol they said the same thing about harden and and they won like game that season let for the full this year ,1
still htown sub tho and think anyone would agree htown over okc place live you like good food and thicc woman ,1
and then got hurt and wa never the same ,1
injury derailed his career ,1
because and offense westbrook kind took hardens mvp that year more hate for the medium tho for picking narrative just like last year cause let tell you anyone who think harden shouldn have gotten mvp last year ,1
not real ,1
swag ,1
lol aggressive and wrong ,1
nobody not even jordan ha changed the game basketball like steph ha only person you can argue ha had much impact mda that being said not sure where place steph had earned just one final mvp easily the top for ,1

wa once doe that make old ,1
certain street with two our favorite rocket green house cosmicraccooncometh ,1
win another chip sans four all star supporting him give him this otherwise the mother fucking all fucking crazy ,1
rus definitely grew bit more they are basically the same height ,1
rus and green gonna battling over them row though ,1
stacked ,1
green cannot the starting ,1
doc look like wallmart elon musk ,1
smart angle get more playing time crowded guard rotation ,1
it trippy hell lol ,1
get out ,1
okc garbage place live fact not discriminate ,1
harden look like taking shit ,1
want focus all his attention defense and the occasional like pat bev used alright with that definitely could carve out more playing time ,1
ha the past ,1
yeah and get cooked ,1
lol max kellermam think journalist ,1
pretty sure yao his family name ,1
how the shit curry rated over kobe ,1
how ha steph changed the game mda sure half the team the league run aspect his system but steph not doing anything extraordinarily game changing beyond hitting high percentage crazy shot are you suggesting the entire league ha started hitting high percentage crazy shot ,1
yeah but would playing the that instance could guard bigger better sfs and then harden usually guard river would probably guarding guard ,1
he very good ball defender along with eric this only help ,1
think they have comparable hustle that year wasn like last year with giannis clearly robbing james historic offensive year ,1
russia full oil money though there much money local sport that ridiculous basketball soccer you name only few russian player play abroad ,1
joke you nerd everyone know cry when you win something important ,1
you guy have hated rus for while and you think you just got top player telling you once you see this man play you gonna realize top easily ,1
they didn even try lol ,1
don forget house haha ,1
they gonna backtrack and say that they always knew wa great take screenshots know gotta have the receipt ,1
assist per season isn lot though ,1
hope they the first get championship ring and wedding ring the same day ,1
what the fuck you really this petty lmao never said that rus stop changing word for argument said that rus and james still can believe you cared much and were petty after this long lol ,1
harden look like mole rat ,1
sefolosha too old start ,1
where you get the jersey the right can find nbastore ,1
point wa more that you can clearly see how the medium chooses someone because harden won last year then would completely fine with westbrook winning when did but harden ha been runner time and offense again but didn westbrook finish like seed the year won harden couldn win tied for and only one game down from while having better stats than again not knocking westbrook his hustle dude avg triple double for year straight but when people keep changing the criterion for mvp disqualify harden from winning year after year after year get old ,1
omg winning the title this year ,1
tmi ,1
crowder would great imo marcus morris markieff looked rough last year with okc ,1
parent got for last sunday for birthday academy think ,1
well paid professional troll ,1
soooo when signing the manimal ,1
married that not just hated tramel ,1
finished with trash team there reason did not win the next year with and melo expectation were different ,1
lol you really are that slow there inch between them don know how you can see the picture and think they were the same height take special kind person you are obsessed you came back edit your post even though you don care yup just take your ,1
you are correct wa point tho your houston sub where there valid reason that feel wa robbed acting like you have idea why people would think that here weird thing say again glad here and our team and usually about game year but westbrook ha got wanting lot more like don get wrong think one the funnest player watch and with our spacing shooter think going reach new peak this year watch gonna average assist pt some crazy ,1
the grinch ,1
why haven imagined this lineup before nut ,1
the freshest chillest hottest mole rat ,1
lol fuck house house should starting with eric green thabo austin and whatever old center playing that night off the bench keep one harden westbrook all time injury and ,1
pause ,1
felt the same but with harden now love him ,1
defaulted the large red home harden but should have been river now lol ,1
know fml ,1
bout next desktop ,1
unless barry trammel going fly down houston for every post game yea can see him dropping from his arsenal lmao ,1
appreciate the love rockymountain ,1
wa pretty effective off the catch early from wa newsworthy efficiency however just got stung the injury bug the wrong time and involved constant trade talk and just had his family situation around the time iirc either marriage and baby ,1
for sure had honestly forgot that how ended thanks for the reminder ,1
ayy what baby let get this dub ,1
insane how much done this guy love him glad the squad ,1
hoping gallo get bought out and can get him ,1
okay let just say this you obviously have something wrong upstairs you take what say then just use against because you don have enough fucking point speak for yourself edited the comment show people reading how pathetic you are that you were your feel bout losing argument you had name your mind for two week forgot you even existed that time sad stuff really also funny cuz you were actual rocket fan and not buck fan you would know that most likely isn shoe good day but again around you can make informed judgment due the camera angle and think you count hair here cuz you gettin desperate lmao you were the one triggered that you lost argument that you came back with even weaker argument you weren copying mine and you have the audacity call slow special stuff here folk stop responding you you got clue what you talking about fool ,1
harden doe not usually guard lol can very high level for guard but come playoff big trouble sticking harden ,1
goddamn have mvp ,1
obviously that wouldn happening they going against but that instance would either capela guarding him but against lot team that will how wind whether it gordon river starting the ,1
stick boxing max these click bait show get every time ,1
,1
step back from foot behind the line with someone your face any open gym across the country and you now see every year old kid playing exactly like that just look attempt the nba now year ago not saying the best player anything but def changed the game more than any other player harden prob going change how player play the future iso ball with open lane basket much more effective than ppl realize but take very special player play that way ,1
think harden deserved the and mvp tbh not the mvp over rus and lebron just how carried dragged those team wa very much deserved and over curry and giannis not say didn and but just thought rus and lebron did better those year ,1
post ,1
hope everything work out for both trading away rus and got all first round pick hope the rebuild work great for you guy funny how just few year ago the rivalry between our team wa it highest and now feel like the rivalry gone and brother team ,1
goodguy austin ,1
where tho ,1
link the tweet ,1
reminds battier back the yao tmac day ,1
the league not with the shit team gon die tonight ,1
yeah noticed they had dob after then kinda said fuck still his prime though like see him succeed preferably houston ,1
dutch angle ,1
,1
still tippin play the background ,1
just like every other talking head television ,1
god damn glad all set off ,1
let not forget this the guy who said tom brady wa the decline and then brady went win the super bowl ,1
hmm need more info but seems just precautionary still these practice have walk through portion that should getting familiar with ,1
just precautionary wa going through game just few day ago and say ready for opening night probably just easing him back into full activity ,1
isn credible like all espn fox sport all are full bias the only thing that matter are the result award overall championship and steph while ha ha final mvp and all his ring are suspect matter how you look he great player doubt but people are being prisoner the moment hell james ha been better than steph the last season most people still have steph above james people for there own opinion it all bias dont listen people view it ridiculous ,1
hehe and also like playfully think him secret weapon soon full display but not just ,1
htown babyyyyyyy yessir ,1
feel like the introduction advanced analytics ha changed the game and steph entered the league with the best deep shot ever seen however stephs play didn push the league short more three the analytics shot value what ha done that ,1
agreed but wa the face these analytics wa being emulated more than anybody else now smaller player could neutralize bigger player shooting more three much like spread offense football ,1
wa participating full court drill though http twitter com jonathan feigen status http twitter com chronbriansmith status http twitter com chronbriansmith status ,1
least somewhat match our color feel bad for other team where some contrasting logo ,1
playing monday ,1
rather give him couple more day rest both him and james till the rth october against the clipper think will play though but thats just game against the shark doesnt really simulate nba competition and know would help term somewhat getting shape but with all the injury seen just wouldnt play either them maybe also not eric and clint either ,1
chance river start ,1
they got offensive set over here ,1
more chance than green imo ,1
yeah that make sense ,1
outsider here rocket are scarry mean rus can really find his role this team they are going far good luck rocket ,1
wa full court practice ,1
with gallo will suck defensively having james and westbrook already pretty rough from defensive stand point ,1
man didn even think about the ramification tyson tap back for our offense might get extra attempt game hit extra pt every night while also reducing the number opponent opportunity that could very well translate point differential swing every game play that massive ,1
hook ,1
defended pretty well during the last series ,1
enjoy how they passed over multiple player who started wing last year and picked green who arguably played the much gordon did just because unbelievable that play two shooting guard ,1
exactly think wa just happy that got one ,1
very athletic team ,1
there only ball and there also min for that ball around shit annoying ,1
shit the same line thinking with the medium about this duo understand the front for the camera but like good spirit just hope and james prove and everyone else wrong they want work will ,1
shitty as game shitting ,1
wasn pretty good sacramento might great addition the coaching staff here ,1
wa confused why wa fired there they looked like they were developing very well under him ,1
can wait see what can with actual coach leading him presti loved hiring coach that can coach for some reason ,1
hope can help clint realize his defensive potential chandler wa basically the prototype for modern rim running big men ,1
think butted head with some player but took that roster farther than they had any business being ,1
honestly after seeing many real life think both them look lot like shark ,1
how else can you fit them the frame from that range ,1
album coming soon ,1
see you referring old the when you talk about him changing the game wonder didn get the connection only watch the nba ,1
westbrook look happy with ,1
the guy first take dont even believe what they say otherwise they wouldnt always disagree wouldnt take what they say too seriously ,1
max doesn believe any the shit say but creates headline and attention doe anyways ,1
wait where shaq right hand ,1
our roster wouldn looking anything like that kept both them everything would play out way differently ,1
chief not reading all this peace ,1
had make assumption just get rough idea certainly not impossibility can still see making the same trade because the clipper still got haul for him and even with the harden trade lot people thought wa pretty fair deal given kevin martin scoring capability ,1
being houston sub doesn mean have change everything agree with like going the buck sub and all sudden have pretend harden did not have fair shout the mvp truth most mvp race are close people find whoever they identify with more that year and they win otherwise lebron would have more than ,1
literally still can believe ,1
feel like saw this when played here lmao ,1
just put steph and harden the range that sound about right think ,1
not about changing what you think the first thing you said wa you don know why people here didn like westbrook gave you the reason this houston sub where harden ha been robbed multiple year row one which wa one that westbrook got not saying law answering your question that why people here didn like westbrook imagine harden won last year you wouldn their sub and and wonder why they don like harden cause they would think giannis should have won that simple and again don take this hate saying that wasn close because would have for sure supported westbrook wa okc fan this ha been hardens team and been competing against westbrook for year course they will compared and some people are going think one better than the other just cause westbrook the team now and like him doesn mean gonna drop support for harden who ha been houston year ,1
would awesome those three went ,1
don idiot they all shooting much higher rate than before from all over the court you can see you blind ,1
need get off his phone while driving lol legitimately concerned ,1
don think that why people are sleeping rus and harden and presumably real rocket hater well all about the fact that really inconsistent from the point line for all the other pairing that isn really issue and the nba hate train consistent because the other duo that hater have constantly questioned the ben simmons embiid duo and the same idea fortunately point shooting something that can feasibly worked wouldn surprise ha good season shooting the ball there are lot sign pointing the fact that can least average there ,1
hate when people say shit like this because not peep wa uttered when they were winning when got the team within one game the final nobody said word now all sudden overblown chemistry issue cuz disappointing playoff finish ,1
isnt bad lol ,1
all have prime james harden and prime russell westbrook the same team like known for month but actually seeing them the court together like that who gonna stop them ,1
wa responsible for the grizzly defense huge pickup could grab him assistant ,1
need stop driving and filming tho ,1
ain prime rus tho ,1
you see this that russell westbrook setting screen and moving off ball almost like when coach actually tell him something ,1
wa half hoping say told james and rus whenever the floor they not going guarding the best player because already their team like austin humble answer and team first mentality but funny funny ,1
seems like based your hypothetical pick for mvp those year you tend like voting for the guy that le successful team but maybe had face adversity thing you look historically how people have voted for the award they time and time again have voted for the candidate the better team even they didn have the best scoring season over the guy with just the raw number oscar robertson didn win mvp when averaged triple double wilt didn win when averaged and either kobe didn win when averaged actually came voting and the number for bad team with mvp them were very low wa like le than time the year history the mvp award did team lower than the seed their conference that why wa against westbrook mvp would been more fan they consistently voted that way every year the very least voted that way more than time the history the nba but basically just the one time and the two other time when voting that way would benefited the rocket obviously they went back their traditional voting for the best player one the best team criterion ,1
maybe not physically but mentally and having james share the load with look like good setup for his most efficient year yet ,1
mhhh clearly isnt prime rus his game isn what used and saying just bias and don know yet about what you said let hope wait and see ,1
robert covington wa undrafted guy when had him similar say gary clark wound just straight cutting him iirc because wa like the best player the team and needed make room for him for some reason you can really fault houston for not seeing would become servicable starter the nba way back then and arguable that would developed into that while the rocket got good year minute and pressure win philly marcus morris slightly more confusing story traded him for round pick the sun that wa also when acquired thomas robinson from the king who wa similar situation young player rookie deal think there were two reason why moved from him just had glut young pfs the time remember terrance jones wa also someone had recently drafted and think wa the same year well felt like marcus morris wasn getting the job done might well try recoup his value trading him for rounder specifically why would want thomas robinson opposed marcus morris remember people bringing that thomas robinson contract wa much more tradable forget exactly why might just been that wa under rookie control for year longer needed unload his contract for nothing which wound doing and getting nd would able that and cap room wound playing big part because thats what led being able sign dwight howard free agency ,1
not bias his shooting ha declined the past few year but everything else still the top his game ,1
lol this sub been over this but yes need more careful need him for always ,1
pls gawd rus ,1
most off ball movement seen year ,1
idk why but love his stuff his quirky humor too lmao ,1
just don see scenario where playing alongside harden doesn make him better than the last few year and shooting usually go usage rate go down let hope the case for rus ,1
wasn true for last year tho ,1
wristband brodie ,1

mean you proved right you have something wrong mentally and shut the fuck mate know you lying you remember for week but don wanna read for second read the last two sentence all you need read you absolute moron ,1
know mesmerizing somehow ,1
give five game top before go back standing around off ball hope wrong but still only training camp ,1
definitely big mad the thunder still have billy donovan fucking outlasted and rus presti great getting asset all but fucking negligence that billy still the coach that contract extension and the decision keep him should been fireable offense imo that bad coach ,1
dawg gotta say never understood the hate for river always thought seemed like good guy though understand the situation the clipper wasn ideal with his father being the coach and wouldn try blame him for shown least different situation solid teammate then again still think decision golden state wa unfair but understood where could come from after while trying figure out why aside from the easy championship ,1
just rus jumper look smoother also wish could see little bit house mclemore and chandler ,1
have see game especially late the season the playoff this stuff take energy that why player begin slow down and stop doing the least you have take rest day load management which rus and harden never want ,1
wa just thinking that thought would never see with great coach ,1
hell boner fucking fire niggasex ,1
for real like used watch him lot and really looked mechanic broke ain saying shooter but definitely look better camera least and hope translates the game also ,1
dead ,1
clank clank clank ,1
think realistic goal shoot league average that doe that going problem for the league with his playing and getting the rim are going hard stop ,1
yeah our system would well enough since mean harden gordon would increase their well theory excited see westbrook gordon house tucker chandler sometimes all the floor ,1
you mean the guy that ha averaged triple double the last year you even watch basketball ,1
can shoot from three this year that will great sign and it very attainable too regardless here hoping ,1
are you seriously saying better now than his mvp year right now ranking not bette than dame steph year ago people were arguing that wa way better than curry rus literally favorite this game but please stop this nonsense just keeping real and all downvote because you decided that can talk without bias that ridiculous ,1
averaged triple double last year the year before and the year before that his ppg avg wa down this year but his reb asst were higher then his mvp year his ppg wa probably down the last two year because don know paul george ,1
bruh ,1
morpheus when knew neo wa the one ,1
the ankle breaker ankle seems breakable ,1
probably going saying this lot this season brace yourselves houston gonna bomb gotta supportive ,1
after and before pic laxative ,1
homo but rus ha some fine leg ,1
this some serious gourmet shit ,1
lakers ,1
gon win ,1
gamecube nintendo ,1
nsfnba ,1
yeah used all creativity this meme ,1
morey ain player talking player ,1
bro what the fuck are you serious right now are you seriously telling than last year rus wa better than rus from his mvp season the one that got the mvp over harden while this year got outplayed dame every aspect the game offense defense leadership clutch lmao where have you been and repeat rus favorite but stop year old not that young brodie anymore but still top the game ,1
houston ,1
bout drop game the house oop got chubby can wait have dunker back the ,1
doesn matter talking influencers the one who influenced the increase three and the reduction mid range something steph doesn you can credit steph for philosophy that morey ha been instituting for the past decade finally filtering through the rest the league ,1
didn say that what arguing russell westbrook still his prime top the game your word not mine and you think that person isn their prime okay dude ,1
top while wa top arguably top year ago lmao done here brother ,1
poor shooting percentage during playoff the ref ,1
yeah you are you are done because you taking out both side your mouth ,1
god bless you man ,1
,1
yule gurriel asian eye anyone who disagrees ,1
donates swole check his instagram ,1
with both rus harden together about see high short central practice this year ,1
probably westbrook jacking dumb shot incapable making otherwise look like amazing fit ,1
player nba game ppg rph player nba game ppg rpg who better ,1
who you want now what will likely tanking season hire new coach and pay both just pay donovan until you think you have the right piece competitive again ,1
take any day the week and twice sunday the difference that big body that can bang ,1
come with number must not athlete play the game wong ,1
great sturdy body ,1
it bang average ,1
rus look like he having the time his life these clip lmao ,1
,1
,1
not talking influencers this whole post about player ranking rocket fan understand how impactful mda ha been talking about player ,1
what the fuck who said wanted now didn want all this could happened any point the last two year before they trade and the team ceiling go ,1
yeah and his back disagrees ,1
riiiiight high school college football thx tho ,1
bro honestly number sport are for people who could never play the game ,1
the dude the left look creepy fuck that post malone his face nightmare fuel this image ,1
confused what you think wa saying the team just got blown and there nothing you can about now why fire the head coach and start paying new one while you paying him the goal likely not win game for least the next season two keep the bad coach until the end his contract and then find new one then not saying you wanted okc the position now but you can change what happened ,1
you correct lol post malone ,1
back fact either way the point still remains ryan anderson ha had longer more productive career than dmo you can use number you can use the eye test both either way the truth remains the same btw nice try gatekeeping guy ,1
where comment say should fire billy right now say mad still the coach and that should been fireable decision extend him that don understand where you getting this from all ,1
shit bad maybe you right ,1
you immediately downvoted people who ball don care about trifling thing like downvoted you welcome tho ,1
have the same card myself but not bathroom ,1
bro not athletic ,1
tread lightly sirjackiechiles ,1
fine that ball movement drill ,1
because that rivalry had with the clipper during their big three era and then the past two season with the trade also river really wasn this good prior his time with dude game ha gotten way better than wa three season ago ,1
you brought changing the game and included mda who like morey also not player response wa distinctly reply that particular aspect your comment this part the thread clearly focus influencers steph good but not yet changer the nba game although maybe will year down the line ,1
clipper are probably the best bet defensively stacked especially wing also the lakers are big question mark ,1
been saying since the trade for rus the rocket are going play with more ball movement and faster pace this season also totally forgot got tyson chandler know likely not play much match specific guy but really excited have him ,1
wa too distracted every missed shot even focus the drill ,1
god there wa this one play the blazer thunder series that wa sure would get billy fired wa running down hill fast break and just call time out wa bewildered everyone the blazer game thread wa confused ,1
imo isn asset the rocket ,1
nah dawg canada gonna show out fuck gary clark yeah said ,1
for real beard game point ,1
harden ending this season around bet ,1
thunder fan here with the weekly miss westbrook and harden hope houston win the chip comment carry ,1
like for him stay here until retires strapped this franchise his back for almost decade ,1
the ball coming from inside the house ,1
been saying this since about the medium hate harden and love hate harden ,1
always have harden like mvp chance the beginning the season and always end being too ,1
internal tension within the rocket locker room when come back stephen and max kellerman yell stupid theory unnecessarily loud get the bottom this ,1
while shamorie pond laugh ,1
why clemons listed ,1
,1
keeping check going into the season lol although prefer kick back when not slow during the off season hyped ,1
that look like interesting rocket matter rocket ready our rocket launch ,1
might add that ha long range capability ,1
narrative and track record could catch him harden earlier performance optically wa not appealing even rocket fan but they combination maturing and other issue potential concussion the spur series that may clarified some tell all one day like paul pierce needing take and getting wheel chaired out return magnificently and fit some hero narrative lmao regardless harden pull one more ring out then all part the journey not some stigma may stay with him like barkley malone stockton west and such but still mvb ,1
lol wa thinking this exact thing haha half expecting this type narrative and stuff entice viewer their content wish they followed the team enough empathize but nope ,1
giannis ha more receptacle personality and playing style ha nothing with the actual performance they just rather root for giannis whether that fair debatable ,1
think ha use cutter and shooter can get open shot from harden and love see this guy apart good team ,1
four letter ,1
screwed forgot add lol the end ,1
fantasy worth drafting last round now ,1
westbrook nice guy off the court ,1
giannis signed with nike conspiracy ,1
rus definitely least pretty sure harden true and some video even look taller than harden ,1
when you got your ymca hop and future hall famer guarding you ,1
definitely worth flyer life the hypeotential folk see him then will provide excellent value ,1
harden doesn need medium love superstar cause legit top player the league giannis manufactured star that strong player league always want more superstar ,1
can wait see them play ,1
from germany ,1
man need the nba like right fucking now ,1
it wierd cuz when see rus and james stand close each other they look the same when see rus and steph next each other they look the same too and steph well compare the that james guess see today though ,1
when harden got measured the draft combine wa barefoot ,1
rus probably close without shoe all these other guard are significantly smaller which make them look smaller next tank like him ,1
big strong greek man dunk make happy beard man shoot draw foul make angry ,1
the spur series and having never got over the hump not just national medium that kill harden for this local medium and rocket fan have given him crap over the year think his image changing matured and ha done better winning solves everything and championship will change how perceived everywhere ,1
love how all the player obviously tune hoh nothing else ,1
this offseason while explosive news wise ha felt like forever think all beyond hyped for the season ,1
nike doe make them think they are waiting for official dress code state only official nike headband can worn with nike logo the player forehead ,1
maybe but fantasy all about minute hard for anyone contribute fantasy they not playing minute game depends house becoming the kind ultra trusted bench guy that river right now not just regular bench guy ,1
you know what let hope ball out and get rotation spot ,1
they can change the narrative they already set there bunch nba super star that struggle the playoff however winning cure everything regardless they get carried their team and they international player that the nba us for global appeal ,1
medium bias psh conspiracy theorist ,1
adidas shoe pink lemonade will retail when released price hiked get them early all worth but there also offer feature where you could just offer retail and see the seller bite ,1
like every story ever there ha bad guy the better you are the more hater you get ,1
ain lifelong fan unless you dying when harden and morey leave here sticking around miserable that the team being run into the ground but cautiously optimistic right now ,1
hyped too much lmao ,1
curry and lillard aren tall clear day ,1
lillard maybe without shoe ,1
mortal kombat ,1
swap nene and clemons ,1
lol ryno and clint the same height wingspan course different story ,1
people say harden choked had good playoff imo think people dont talk about giannas just because this his first time past the first round kind expected not dominant ,1
goat for resale that not the retail price ,1
blossomgame don know who this man but that name one hundred fire ,1
paul pierce innit ,1
like ever whoever and whenever wa people probably complained unless they really liked the guy pretty much every innovation basketball ha been complained about player never pushed the game would still that horrible only pas style from way back the day ,1
papa very old ,1
gotta cut five player blossomgame pond frazier bennett clemons ngl wanted see bennett ball but those are the obvious that are gonna get cut ,1
they like giannis and are trying push his the next greatest player ever and ever since harden repeated what dwight howard said about the two them being the cornerstone the medium turned harden they even buried the fact that harden just repeated what howard said harden should have never went that sonic with dwights self centered as ,1
man know nene stay shape maybe front office just want him rest lol ,1
who the fuck care dude ,1
only gotta cut can way ,1
may someone link that video ,1
wasn going play anyway now just have the excuse for why not prepped and ready roll out until inevitably trade him and some team for top protected second round pick ,1
clemons and bennett for way please ,1
http reddit com rocket comment get that shit outta here austin darylmorey this yeah morey shot this video ,1
step back have been around long time harden just perfected the gather step aspect the point making reliable way create open look that practiced enough make efficient rate and thus pissing people off mainly because they couldn cut steph holding his chest ,1
manufactured star little far ,1
every photo harden wa clearly taller when they stand next each other ,1
tweet http twitter com rocket insider status ,1
remember seeing clip step back way back when wa playing for okc ,1
http imgur com cldw jpg harden little taller ,1

http www nba com rocket live medium day here the stream for medium day ,1
sound like riverdale character ,1
people who hate hardens playing style like those old fart baseball who hate people for bat flip watch child play basketball they have fun and pretend they are steph james they just don want embrace change ,1
harden repeatedly disrespected the medium any sport medium and you see the ratio nice mean post about him despite this mildly reputable sport medium source say anything le than top player and consistently front runner for mvp his skill literally undeniable and living rent free all these nephew mind glad you get the right side history the medium ha say what you enjoy watching your job fan stand him why you think want retire rocket feel all love ,1

yeah know but not part the team anymore ,1
wa game between columbia and fordham probably ,1
one the only factual statement the article player shoot about four five percentage point better http fansided com introducing free throw split the second free throw and somewhere around six nine percent better the third shot compared the first this make sense for obvious reason taking warmup shot two make shot easier removing the second and third shot player would live and die that first worse shot that not only lower the overall percentage but consolidates the risk one miss mean point this would not only good for the league but necessary kyle refers harden annoying and describes opposing mind good guy the massive difference between the first and third shot would disproportionately affect some especially annoying player james harden who us the universally loathed stop and flail move draw more three shot foul than any nba team http fivethirtyeight com feature james harden get fouled more than any nba team would see the efficiency those play plummet enough dissuade him from doing perhaps not but his reward for playing litigation ball would lessened which minor win for the good guy anti harden sentiment from kyle again referring rule experiment welcome first step that where are today and the reason harden completely the right play the way doe will take more drastic action than even this experimental rule change that truth but implementing the nba would nonetheless welcome first step ,1
the sound isn working for ,1
same ,1
ditto ,1
stream starting now ,1
love hartenstein being slotted second tier and stretch one that hopefully his foot got lighter because loved what saw the perimeter when wa guarding that one early season game last year ,1
someone tweet the rocket fix the sound ,1
wonder how much nbpa influenced president iggy conspiracy think they just affirm the decision already made the nba just playing with the fun narrative lightly lol ,1
yup ,1
sure would nice hear ,1
wa stated that inaccuracy buddy hield age what motivated this process step added ,1
bad lol stuck head too mortal kombat among those that want stay the team and all the team this league parity finally ,1

well they got the audio working least ,1
this stream off air for still ,1
sound back praise yeezus ,1
btw need new practice facility know wa discussed last season but are they going renovate create new one probably beneficial for the team attached the game arena somehow like the warrior the new chase center could technically warm with skill work immediately prior checking into game although their snafu wa that they have climb down the stair from their practice facility into the arena which ha hazard risk john wall james frickin ennis hurting himself the stair ,1
nvm working ,1
did you refresh ,1
le cringy watching tilman next tad instead morey ,1
gotta skip this section don want hear tillman speak tbh ,1
bout drippin the whole nba like leaky faucet ,1
yep finally working for good thanks for the suggestion ,1
tillman got facepalming already ,1
not like them doing the ppl first feel idk ,1
did not know thabo name ,1
wait that last one ninja turtle ,1
this yall owner lol wtf doe have medium training ,1

tillman sure hyping house after refusing pay him last year ,1
already plugged his book lol ,1
you read book you have know what you know and what you don know awkward silence ,1
cu ,1
owner dick ignore him ,1
tillman with the subtle book plug ,1
maybe you should replace nene you athlete ,1
you think tilman just mad that everyone spell his last name with two ,1
everybody tell mike the right guy for the team truly not see mike going anywhere and all know usually shoot you straight maybe the way business don like the word lame duck ,1
tad did not like that shoulder tap ,1
tilman checking his book sale number his phone ,1

like this man the gray suit this the what his like area expertise ,1
this ,1
http www nba com rocket tad brown ,1
want them off the stage ,1
yes but most the medium day don leadership until the end another conference ,1
hartenstein literally ha nothing else prove the league torched them every way from range defense and playmaking his position need make this leap ala clint leap year ,1
tillman ha uncanny resemblance naked mole rat ,1
realistically but really hope stick around cover for those inherent injury and rest management challenge may face one the league oldest team and that shine those limited minute and get role elsewhere here long term very wishful thinking eventually plus could somehow survive get close the playoff and even not the playoff roster still might get ring right lol ,1
quote the day basketball operation guy are very good tilman aka sherlock ,1
what did they feed clint this summer ,1
and somehow avoided the bait saying disagrees with the nba disagreement with nene contract ,1
patch back wtf will not awayyy ,1
yeah sorry but any player who average the playoff defies the label being choker ,1
league ,1
and ain our problem league ,1
this ha kinda been awful technical experience very hard not think this isn cheap franchise lol dah well will catch the highlight ,1
new wallpaper ,1
the curious case russell westbrook real height continues ,1
many issue with the stream like come ,1
remember when all traded james harden over ,1
outside fan observer you guy have one the worst run medium day seen usually try watch most team and this the most technical difficulty ever seen ,1
man how they gonna end after the first player lol ,1
yes year ago you guy are doing this this after cutting half your team last season get under the tax low balling your coach having what sound like older facility with broken chair and more learned our lesson hopefully houston will too ,1
this ha been infuriating watch back yet tired refreshing see the beginning the stream again just bush league ,1
this amazing the detail all the shoe and the unis much swag love those black the middle ,1
the rhino pic should more frontal match the other ,1
not yet hope for harden and westbrook ,1
had the same stream problem last year thunder medium day tbf you couldn hear shit for like half the day ,1
brooooo ,1
there that the mavs guy who wa talking trash about you guy rus and harden ,1
got freeze god and even refresh can get going again anyone else ,1

whoever the rocket tech guy probably us internet explorer and dial ,1
imma fuck everyone this year the league the medium the nephew nba all getting made bitch sit back and watch actual quote from james harden that you can dispute because the stream joke ,1
don know how this could get any more embarrassing the fact that only few team have early medium day really put spotlight how bad this ha been ,1
imagine waiting all summer hear anyone the team speak and this happens ,1
this stream embarrassing ,1
doe anyone know member the medium that live streaming would even take grainy cellphone footage over waiting for them figure out this stream ,1
that would sweet ,1
book sale haven met projection lmao ,1
river seemed have had lot quotable moment would have been cool see ,1

ehhh look like harden ha about inch him ,1
lmao morey right now just dropping cuss word constantly ,1
harden ,1
harden look have inch maybe two him here not completely sure because angle and posture though ,1
man kobe ,1
nah the league medium can have that not family friendly enough also doesn run his mouth about how hard his upbringing wa ,1
love the pic hate the title ,1
gerald green good mood ,1
don recall that and watched damn never everyone speak even still wa fixed ,1
have feeling the league know they fucked ,1
gerald green got hyped ,1
kobe wasn medium favorite either all the time either ,1
team usa legend tucker now ,1
while the one legged shot doesn appear likely very high percentage one actual nba game confidence account for lot the threat arguably more valuable than the actual effectiveness the shot like curry half court range harden brandishing weapon that know his defender know ha one that previously never had factored into defense calculus just another element harden unplaceable purposefully convoluted time signature and probably not the only one ready unveil ,1
that just true all situation ,1
westbrook for anyone tuning for him ,1
rus new chapter ,1
kobe grew privileged ,1
buy iptv ,1
now this content ,1
think wa talking about harden ,1
truly taller his head just elongated ,1
harden like though maybe they are and guess well find out lol ,1
mean must only about ha shown improvement like for him stick around ,1
tough ,1
generally played pretty well the odd san antonio game what really haunt him think ha matured since then hard for them accept simple truth like that wa extremely strange and disappointing big stage otherwise been solid last season had good post season ,1
,1
they call rus ninja turtle man ,1
usually start out good time but then end really really bad time that keep happening ,1
those knee are freaking out ,1
the chosen one there can only one and the force chooses those who are called serve ,1
term absolute scoring dominance wherever whenever wa right hope that harden can win championship least road remains tough but could happen ,1
look their shoulder height dude ,1
think people are underestimating how good harden westbrook duo will personally also wonder what westbrook doe new system role ,1
wonder what year said this ,1
,1
why jamie selling insurance for progressive when ha successful medical career ,1
remember being courtside watch him practice his step back during pre game warmups okc and having very similar feeling wa never one those okc fan who wa surprised his dominance hou ,1
wa say the first person remember doing wa iverson and pretty frequently that who got from ,1
the only one who want see them the new throwback ,1
know joking ,1

need the whole uni top and bottom and really need the white like really really really need least the short them because got hakeem ,1
there are definitely multiple other kind dog tho like what about bird dog large but well behaved dog that go dog show ,1
like bird dog like the way they point stuff and know fetch bird that have been shot without ruining the kill bird dog are super smart ,1
nba hero ,1
imma say what people usually think ,1
the white throwback are underrated ,1
miss trevor ,1

doc really hope this your username ,1
nice bought mine back when they released and just got email today saying wa shipped did get westbrook jersey today and only ordered day ago though ,1
that the face man who just met his childhood superhero ,1
more like solution ,1
boomed him ,1
with shoe ,1
funny the length people will slight this guy for some inexplicable reason almost everyone universally agrees this rule change would stupid ,1
you can never have too many ball handler lost that run imo because didn have ball handler when harden wa out the game struggling had jason terry the like morey built team with westbrook harden lebron simmons jokic would people really say that ball stuff talent always find way work together ,1
yeah that the one series where imo you can say choked and had few playoff series before then where been inefficient but these last two post season run been pretty good imo mean you really want critical you can look that utah jazz series wa held point and assist le than efg but the same time utah obviously top defensive team and the way the series wa basically over after game and most the game were blowout kind hard really critique any result from that series but again look the next series against golden state game hitting his normal efficiency perfectly fine series for him ,1
hehe everyone flirting with the rocket these day mean who doesn want play with harden and rus that not buy the medium that they not good teammate don even know how that exists houston great organization ,1
,1

this post wa wondering why wasnt showing dunno what the problem ,1
the player ever saw the post here jesus ,1
only guaranteed mclemore contract additionally cost more against the cap than any the over vet min guy besides nen and play position strength need show lot order win spot imo ,1

mind watching this live still look like math teacher ,1
somebody pls badly photoshop rus face ,1
welcome back anderson ,1
feel really bad about the rocket killing trading him ,1
more like that pas ,1
think ryno look like the pre evolved form joe ingles ,1
count this probably getting deleted ,1
mcdowell white person ,1
this make ryno look like melo ,1
how many can you take camp seems like there signing every week and like player now ,1
his three point form just beautiful could watch all day that really weird know ,1
those are the two curious about let send them the league they can get some run ,1
every year get worse too this year kawhi and came west while the only western star east wa durant who out for the year last year james and derozan came west while kawhi went east another net influx star the west like this every year and keep getting worse yeah and the pelican just added zion ,1
yeah dont understand the fan base melo look pretty useful even the guy sits the bench clearly said fine with ,1
miss for three ,1
couldn hit the ocean with beach ball before his departure but hey that still the case cut him and move nothing more than another aging vet situation team friendly deal ,1
come with some weird stuff but find their projection are typically decent not sure how the clipper are low their eye though normalizing their odds knock some the luster off the rocket and sixer lesser degree put our odds little below realistically favorite final matchup but only about best come out the west despite being the team beat harden tough project but confident there won regression his game his number may take hit depending what kind scheme are going run but guess his most efficient shooting year more than enough secure his second mvp after finish the top seed the west ,1
yeah really choosy who good some player you know that are really good aren favored ,1
lmao hope this joke ,1
saw someone instagram lol ,1
think melo ha place the league bench scorer playing mpg but gotta show can accept and embrace that role before that can happen think team want see him the best shape his life could get for year being slightly heavier but want team gotta his conditioning also help him stay the floor defense which probably most team biggest concern ,1
lmo coming back the rocket too ,1
this team had chance fucking legendary fully believe this organization cursed ,1
get free steak buy the book tho ,1
why ariza sitting over there himself lol ,1
there were some painful one but don speak the dark day the day god brought beard and all wa right the world again ,1
you shut your whore mouth mother fucking clutch city not curse city get outta here with that bullshit take clevland something ,1
you know didn notice but why practicing midrange shot lol ,1
,1
the only thing that worry mvp wise not that big deal but deserves another that his ppg will likely down and with that the narrative that wasn good enough win last year ppg that deserves even le even more efficient hopefully not but man that doesn sound like argument that will come next year ,1
anything that project the er the final cant too well calculated also nate silver fucking moron ,1
literally nobody thought wasn good enough win last year just that the buck were the best team and had high quality candidate the top seed the west ha high quality candidate will likely enough win mvp unless some second seed guy ha crazy season east team win ,1
free hahahahaha that word doe not his vocabulary ,1
simple the medium based out los angeles new york miami chicago and philadelphia those team get more love than others and they are bias the medium also gamble they put other team down their chance winning the la vega odds not conspiracy houston ha been building depth quietly compared lakers and clipper yet the medium doesn bring and not only that they speak bad westbrook even tho fit houston style play and this the best team houston ha ever ,1
agree but also don know deserved but buck were better record just saying that there another top seed candidate this something could see hurting his case even though shouldn ,1
they really did the first time okay had injury but last playoff losing like they did huge disappointment ,1
could see windhorst using that excuse there are few voter who just aren going vote for harden matter what but the vast majority are just checking box regardless who doe seed important box ,1
lol the ordering this list all jacked but let them harden story not over ,1
lowry scola hayes wa fun time watch this team the last time remember truly dark day half this sub wasn even born ,1
think harden spot fair for where his career right now that around where have him honest final appearance would catapult him where wade the list final win with fmvp would probably put him ahead dirk ,1
weird list respect some what they done risk wise though steph and shaq are too high and robinson front dream doe not work for any level although hakeem front kobe fine okay with harden long they bump him least spot when win this year ,1
that fair and his one final appearance doesn count since the contribution load wa spread between rus and his young self off the bench backing thabo even though coach pop explicitly stated that feared game planning for the beard more than the other two ,1
looking back wasn melo supposed fill ryno void lol hit trey and not able perimeter defend really should the league still ,1
fertitta bum ,1
shoot just stopped subscribing early last year because outline com and work discount and now they longer able bypass the paywall sorry ,1
thats about where had harden and rus they end winning chip this year would move harden like the range and rus the mid late ,1
finally someone put kobe out the top not sure better than barkley though ,1
have you tried throwing beach ball into the ocean those thing fly off the wind all the time ,1
all remember when there wa post about his colorblindness how shoot better every color except red didn forget that ,1
left the page after saw curry top spot ,1
the astros sub ,1
same such good player and person wish him the best every season matter what team ,1
non guaranteed probably will get cut but look like morey think worth chance ,1
this past saturday saw man wearing rocket ryan anderson jersey downtown first thought wa that the guy probably got from the nike outlet store where been sitting for for month and thought would look fly little did know the guy wa time traveler ,1
astros and rocket championship the same season ,1
you wrong and here why stephan smith ,1
harden ha said quiet few time want retire here and even bought into the dynamo really think will here for his whole career unless fertitta doe some stupid shit piss him off ,1
kobe won mvp year after averaged long harden grab the first seed and post bpm and vorp greater than win the award don even think harden really care about winning more mvp now though probably save most his juice for the playoff ,1
shooter you practice from all area the floor start close the basket and then move further out calibrate the shot ,1
fully believe that want retire houston just don know that the smartest use him asset ,1
while his spending definitely something think most are least little concerned with still happy bought the team least know won move the team out houston ,1
think keep him long want here hopefully end his career here like dirk did dalass ,1
sometimes you have look past market value sometimes it about beeing grateful for what one ha done for team are eventually going need tank thikn should stop running away from that thought and accept harden ha played his soul out for and will continue deserves dirk esk retirement with and would really happy happened even cost ,1
look better free agent look these guy more than just asset that includes fan it bad look look guy like harden asset even when eventually get the twilight his career ,1
unless asks for there chance morey trade him ,1
might not the best thing for the team but hope don look him asset enters the downward slope after his prime want him rocket uniform until the day retires hopefully with ring two along the way that delay houston ability rebuild retool for couple year like kobe retirement did for the lakers ,1
bruh that morey mentality infectious ,1
chris clemons like ,1
daryl morey ha also said multiple time that never plan trading james harden ,1
maybe the next nate robinson ,1
saw hakeem ctrl hakeem and wa like thats not bad then saw and realized why this wa posted wow ,1
this list isn too bad apart from the top lol there universe where robinson top guy himself better than olajuwon well sure there universe where hakeem play hockey but you know what mean the author make really good case for durant which honestly one can argue with close the final ppg untouchable but regarding hakeem they seem have forgotten the same argument putting his team his back for championship hakeem case that elevates dirk the same article ,1
what you nene ,1
gut feeling daryl morey see his exit the horizon the team ha draft equity young prospect and bunch soon already are bad contract trying win championship the next year and not won his problem anymore ,1
love how shaq with his massive ego put hakeem above himslef yet the clown who wrote this article think know more than shaq ,1
triggered that you put before ,1
http streamable com hxzf utm source shareutm medium io apputm name iossmf ,1
wa watching the dark day stevie francis migraine along with rotation moochi cat shandon anderson the thru position those were dark day love cat and stevie tho ,1
saw this way home from class today and thought wa the funniest thing ,1
not sure why this sub keep forgetting this but gary clark this team like not signed guaranteed money until not getting cut sent the gleague when there several guy non guaranteed money contract right now ,1
careful with that statement that same argument can used put kobe ahead lebron all the player that went against both them seem lean towards kobe being the better player obviously when looking court impact that isn true all honestly peak shaq wa better than olajuwon offense olajuwon wa probably the best defender all time though the way see the two them were similar tier but give the slight edge shaq because value offense more you can have extreme respect for player and say they were better than you even they weren peak gary payton made john stockton his bitch but you listened gary payton would tell you stockton wa better than him ,1
get chance and with that shot his wouldn surprised get decents minute even garbage time ,1
texan ,1
moochie wa great but that short sliver stevie cat yao wa sooooo much fun ,1
realistically see nene giving sporadic minute backup capela and chandler ideally though hartenstein make that jump and don need nene ,1
salt grass suck too ,1
hahaha apology dominus ,1
until retires would not make sense move from harden who top rocket all time and very loyal the franchise you don just cut bait with historic player that are loyal bad look for future great you want acquire ,1
from everything everyone ha stated far seems they plan keep harden until least close the end his career ,1
hope make that jump this year but from everything seen summer league hasn rooting for the big fella but also have player ready take that spot ,1
david robinson lawddd ,1
agree variance training shooting one foot front and one foot behind the trey help hit the normal trey range source trey point shooter three year varsity had great statistician lmao ,1
subscribed ,1
whoa whoa whoa who saying guy geery going get cut ,1
wa actually nodding along with almost all this until got the absolute sham hakeem spot behind shaq and behind david robinson other big complaint wa elgin baylor and moses malone were each about spot too low actually think the spot they ranked all the modern player were very sane and well reasoned appreciate them normalizing everything per possession stats put wilt oscar number more sane context and highlight how great harden westbrook curry are ,1
road ryno the best ryno ,1
not even the worst owner all time would move the team out houston ,1
anyone suggesting ever trade james harden can suck dick from the back can have roster spot when foot under his family can still collect check for all care harden want here then want him here full stop ,1
think clemons bennet get cut unfortunately ,1
they have fully guaranteed contact you silly ,1
god damn this porn dmorey guy running straight into the corner for quick catch and shoot corner and splashing them that exercise got excited hope get gary clark doing training like this ,1
bud adam would like word with you ,1
melo will come back before the deadline and win ring with ,1
honestly like see bennett court but this point unlikely you said ,1
the white knight return ,1
thought the same about the sonics getting moved from seattle until clay bennett happened ,1
don know why your getting down voted dude straight shit head guess people don wanna admit went from great owner garbage one but mean come his book called shut and listen with cover just his face have several heard several bad thing from people who have met him seems like just garbage dude ,1
rather have bennett get cut then clemons because chris showed some real skill the summer ,1
wa fun because the dark day experienced leading that kelvin cato shandon anderson taylor eddie griffin moochie kenny thomas walt williams dan langhi etc etc those team lacked talent and down the roster francis and cat winning game strictly iso ball couple year before yao wa actually impressive looking back ,1
incredibly impressive remember when stevie came back towards the end mac career had one great game before hanging feel like russy the closest thing term intensity and fire stevie that had houston since ,1
went from neutral good owner le straight narcissistic cheap asshole the sad part it going run like family business already grooming his middle child involved the basketball decision once morey harden dip gone with them and this coming from life long fan that been with the team since ,1
move out houston are you kidding you think the nba would approve move out houston one the largest market out there maybe the that would have gone down but this different era they were talking about moving the rocket louisville for fcks sake lmao you think that would option today ,1
why are losing almost all the game these highlight were pulled from ,1
next ariza ,1
all black ppl don look alike fam ,1
fertitta mob bot trying bring our boy down ,1
robinson over hakeem laughable robinson wa incredible but fringe top best thought hakeem settled this when dad dicked him the wcf ,1
clemons likely going league around most likely imo ,1
alright buddy why don you shut and listen for second ,1
would fucking comical somehow ha career best season now and becomes genuine asset after the whole merry round being signed proper third option offloaded eye wateringly costly albatross and now brought back partially guaranteed filler won happen but would funny did ,1
yeah but hindsight ,1
replace clemmons with clark and that probably kinda wanted see bennet get some minute but idk how crack into this rotation ,1
hope rus keep wearing the ninja headband even supposedly banned ,1
rus ,1
crack the rotation being good shooter and playing solid defense his main competition ryan anderson have hope for the kid especially the defensive end ,1
prime hakeem olajuwon the greatest center ever play the game ,1
can definitely see that hopeful for happening main concern who replaces our lineup and how our top look pretty tight aside from clemmons who ha shown can ball out but not very high him because his size hoping bennet take his spot the lineup ,1
russell westbrook the houston rocket ,1
those are not the want him taking lol ,1
russell carmelo anthony westbrook ,1
happened the sonics ,1
would prefer these over his midrange pull jumper ,1
source ,1
maybe thunder fan have noticed but always found wb shot weird like jump straight and down with very little sweep and sway motion ,1
plz ,1
who did westbrook replace the pic lol ,1
bruh dump off chandler austin you gonna get blocked all the time hanging like that ,1
playing utah jazz defense ,1
would have been much le likely happen today nba seattle and houston much bigger market than wa year ago http www seattletimes com seattle news data more people seattle now this decade fastest growing big city all united state ,1
anthony bennett won denied ,1
forever ,1
thabo not idk why clemons wa put where you had him harden will running ,1
yes clearly there are many people driving around town looking for place eat and upon seeing that tilman ghost written book sold here they decided come ,1
hopefully not taking those during the season ,1
why melo the back lol ,1
used automatic with that cotton shot ,1
how dare you slander bobby ,1
hyped for the westbrook pairing and watching the game from when not work timezones will have about time smh ,1
had ,1
who your next team gonna ,1
melo pump faking even practice ,1
shoot three houston texas ,1
would fucking comical somehow ha career best season now and becomes genuine asset after the whole merry round being signed proper third option offloaded eye wateringly costly albatross and now brought back partially guaranteed filler won happen but would funny did ,1
still think the only reason cut him wa because bzdelik hated his as ,1
how steph top and hakeem isn ,1
here the link http www reddit com astros comment lggm jeff lunhowdaryl morey interview sort confidence ,1
big true ,1
have keep the defense honest think been working the bigger hope that respectable compared his drop off recent year and doe not fall the beginning the season that adjusts and the team strategy adjusts towards four man out spread offense and attack the rim pull for his infamous cotton shot that faded recently glass half full ,1
except roberson ,1
cotton shot ,1
why not lol unprofessional hope too and they lift the nonsensical restriction ,1
chris ain wrong ,1
would prefer neither doe not need taking contested pullups from anywhere can take all the open can but he being guarded need get into the paint he putting shot ,1
think they look dumb lol not gonna miss ,1
not many player take pullup contesed like that lol you can keep the defense honest better way rus not great off the dribble shooter let hope doesnt take many his shot attempt should almost all the rim catch and shoot open want use him well ,1
that list fucking bullshit ,1
you make good point contested absentmindedly forgot that take low percentage hero ball like shot off the break that not make sense and doesn squeeze the most out possession wa hoping that the long rebound favorable for but haven been able rebound effectively last year even without huge proportion pters hope sens that but this clip prof your point that doe not see that way yet unless dropping them practice right now after summer working his shot lol holding breath ,1
yep two motion shot shoot while the top his jump instead the way ,1
seattle not houston nor even close ,1
gotta love lol ,1
austin river will remember that ,1
wasn getting that before austin must have made miscalculation and not adjusted lol ,1
look pretty lean man plus working like dog agree that his role need scorer off the bench his starter day are over but how doe one prove without getting shot seeing some shitty league guy get deal ahead him understand that shouldn everyone radar but past joke when the net sign two nobody and the piston grab joe johnson yet fully healthy and shape first ballot hall gamer can get job can understand why portland don want him shunned them for couple year wouldn lower himself play portland co wa arrogant and entitled but after that almost every team bar the top team could use him meaningful role mean shit dwight howard seemed destined forgotten and even got job ,1
trim the video before uploading ,1
his shot ha def changed wa watching some highlight from his masked span game and you can see the difference from today shot ,1
should probably either depending how you compare him with harden and hardens beard ,1
def compare old rus the rus last season the shot seemed really broken ,1
the io update the iphone combined with inability figure out the trim saved for the uploadable version typically trim and compile neatly but tried the parking lot before checking for ton quarterly meeting today lol tried trim using reddit and thought did here and failed haha deleted couple post just this bad let this one lapse and saw that wa poorly executed figure out fio soon ,1
god hope make the team need him great ,1
you and other player chose send austin shit into the row ,1
ariza have open arm baby ,1
agree those pull shouldn thing maybe game but that max hope rus and james shoot few mid range shot game like where you put them down the post elbow and let them work they both very strong reason why play can created there more often than not mid range shot don mind nor should daryl mike ,1
yea dont wanna judge too harshly this one shot wa hot and feeling than it tempting pop one those trust get ,1
rus pretty decent catch and shoot guy just hope doesn try force bad anymore ,1
yea james used work the post well few year back think they both strong the offense struggling he just incredible the iso and pick and roll it typically not worth switch ,1
will traded the last year his career ,1
how clemons ryno clemons will not playing forward wtf this ,1
river still beat him lol cmon rus step unless let him get the block ,1
probably only banned till nike make their own that they have wear ,1
his strength isn finishing the rim problem part the game plan let player like him get run that stuff like this can happen ,1
bleacher report ,1
love how terrible keeping with the lyric just like make more real ,1
have plenty beef with rus game but god that dude competitor ,1
figured but well see ,1
for the past few year this how rus ha been defending time give guy lane either side ,1
talking about bennett dude ,1
responded the wrong thing meant comment the post not your comment ,1
very likely result his knee injury and developed new motion shot where can use more force from his arm and le from his knee guessing but that open more room for error ,1
think it pretty obvious who get cut pond and clemons who will sign way contract frazier and blossomgame who will just sign with our league team lastly bennent who imo will just get cut full stop unfortunately also think ryno placeholder guy till the buyout market think will the one getting cut better power forward that fit our system becomes available for example marvin williams but thats like bit down the line like our squad alot more this season than last ,1
the olajuwon special final gift pick prospect before coming back for the retirement party ,1
same trying get mentality root for his game ,1
ha begun ,1
please ,1
using bumper plate hide the fact that using light weight look like about lb ,1
hey what about luc mbah mute ,1
thought other player didn like playing with harden though welcome back ryno ,1
play gary clark ,1
love see him execute the redemption arc his story ,1
that what ryan anderson look like rocket again ,1
lmaoo wa thinking damn james looking tall from this angle and lightskin and then realized wa ,1
james harden russell westbrook and ryan anderson prepare start the nba pre season ,1
and that part make even le sense when you take into account the not educated part the original quote ,0
lebron james sign with shanghai shark for season promise not not not not title ,0
good look papi ,0
disappointed lebron james staying quiet the subject one thing but calling morey misinformed and uneducated wow money and brand over democracy and freedom speech ,0
muhammad ali wa american fighting for right american you don see the difference ,0
but did they get cheered fan game their experience doesn hold candle lebron suffering ,0
this may greater dis than bum ,0
this whole situation ha left with such bad taste mounth idk can even get excited for the season ,0
the one slightly defensible thing about what tsai said that gave some potential historic context why china would think that individual freedom dangerous lebron straight just say bad financially ,0
like misinformed and not educated ,0
this fucking terrifying duo ,0
use version this irl people like more when don talk ,0
doe bron even know wtf going hong kong ,0
wa more important morey voice his opinion than have china money then ha the right say top what you said not even his money weighting that lebron point morey money then all mean ha every right but not even his money morey burned billion dollar someone else money and then here like dude totally worth man this tweet worth billion buck lebron totally right are just burning other people money and acting all high and mighty about ,0
hope space jam crash and burn ,0
everyone else can talk about this shit also here why stand for these issue america ,0
removed ,0
http medium giphy com medium szw prwzyuv giphy gif honestly right now not sure which the bigger heel turn ,0
you gotta respect the ball him for speaking ,0
really good find ,0
favorite curry stat the higher his usg the better his pps only high volume player history routinely that ,0
ha billion dollar deal with nike they own him for life and china owns nike how could anyone expect anything different here ,0
yes exactly none these people saying fuck china have stopped buying iphone nike which are basically built chinese slave yet they all get arm the one dude who saying what all the other player and league official are clearly thinking ,0
more like because they could have been arbitrarily detained lol have you not heard about the uyghers ,0
sorry couldn quite make that out with china dick deep down your throat ,0
yeah this where the disconnect though the original issue with laura ingraham saying should shut and dribble wa that she wa saying his feeling matter that were important him weren valid because wasn his job comment those issue lebron isn saying morey can tweet what want simply stated that morey wa misinformed for tweeting not understanding the consequence which probably the same thing any one with background would have told morey which why morey deleted the tweet lebron probably doesn know enough about the issue isn invested enough about say nothing crucify him for taking stance matter that one expected any nba player coach take stance can help but understand where lebron coming from the entire shit storm not something think the nba expected deal with before the season started they are international league with plenty invested international market morey had taken the time think how this affected the entire league meaning player who didn know enough about the issue then think would have waited make statement that had more clarity and wouldn catch entire league off gaurd ,0
oda writing the script for the nba the side something ,0
commenting the sudan really isn controversial that the difference ,0
kobe would never ,0
lebron such idiot for using the word misinformed and not educated obviously meant morey wa short sighted for tweeting something politically charged without thinking about the ramification all seriously think lebron all people think supporting misinformed ,0
just don ,0
taco tuesday believe you might misinformed james ,0
thank you kanter finally player with courage least call out the ,0
lol much for freedom speech right ,0
don wanna all ackthually but that pronounced ching james ,0
people aren acknowledging the fact that lebron might know someone that need organ tho still possible doing this for benevolent reason there could make wish kid that didn mention ,0
these are conservative agenda pushed conservative lawmaker these blood are conservative hand not all american mean that isn really true all lol ,0

trump wa using not talking about negotiation chip his misguided trade war and already said way worse stuff about china for year nah just him being pussy not some big brain move prevent world war lol ,0
but the wizard aren wasteland because beal though kyrie had everything set for him contend and still turned that team underachiever and imo wa mostly his fault because the guy that been there and done all beal wa classy and balled hard even despite the rumor him and wall not getting along management being absolute trash and rumor him being traded blowing that make him better leader already not saying kyrie can better leader but hasn shown especially when wa the one that asked for beal didn ask for and still showed could ,0

don literally saw double team all year being that wa dallas only above average offensive player siakam can handle double team thats knock him siakam never saw opposing team best defender kawhi wa the game meanwhile luka saw double team and the opposing team best defender constantly ,0
yeah wa playing with klay and what doe that have with this season presumably play more minute because the warrior might not make the playoff otherwise and even play the same amount minute going have much higher usage rate ,0
really don think that unlikely forecast something like this happening although one can necessarily predict random twitter post from someone like daryl morey the escalation the china hong kong situation evident and with the season approaching the likelihood that someone contracted involved with the nba would comment isn that low these people with ownership stake the nba who have money throw around definitely know and undertake business with china and can see now from the deafening silence across the nba this issue they know what speaking about this issue could their investment don think it that unreasonable ,0
when saw the thread wa talking someone who doesn care for sport and her reaction wa legit athlete doe what supposed you know how awkward that conversation explaining how simmons doesn shoot them and then she trying say simmons bad player because doesn take them ,0
rebuilding ,0
the point that probably relied more than play longer ,0

and kawhi the new and scottie ,0
wa literally used that role and wa great they ran high post ups handoff all the time could pas there reason averaged assist for nearly decade jokic just better honestly ,0
tiktacko ,0
why you post you don know what you are talking about ,0
this dude really using espn ranking his main point argument get zion getting little too much hype espn ranking always suck jae crowder above derozan anyone but why put much merit into anyways just look like you the lone contrarian when their purpose just hype the kid and then write endless article him ,0

also think about inflation his money will worth more now than will the end his contract ,0

,0
people thought the sun would buy out baynes after they acquired him for some reason instead using very good for their own team iguodala probably isn professional baynes perhaps bad influence that young locker room maybe just better cut their tie think there lot morant and jjj could learn from him but not willing help the young guy not worth having never really been that old mature head that stand adversity for bad team kinda like ariza for the sun who didn really help out that locker room all they done the hard work they just want ring now ,0

pretty funny how many you social medium warrior only ever take first step though lol but foreal awareness doe lead change however what change occurs may determined your response won fault someone for thinking about what change they want see and what the best way respond order have the desired impact won fault someone for not responding all they unsure whether the change they might incur with unthoughtful response will more beneficial than change all who are trying spread awareness our own citizen the people china who may may not know what their government doing think losing influential presence there and turning them hostile help them receive the awareness looking spread what you think this the first step toward exactly what are your projection for the future everyone responded the way you think they should what are the risk would you willing let this escalate complete economic disassociation with china war with china you know what kind effect those thing could have hong kong the the world did you ever consider that beyond the financial incentive maybe the nba think they more good bringing people together globally through sport and further increasing their influence that region promote change another way rather than throwing away access little antagonizing which unlikely produce any kind positive result ,0
genuinely pathetic unemployment really that bad for someone who already ha million dollar and could quit their job any time ,0

definitely appreciate the comment deathbycuddle but honestly all just here for our love for the game and talk about love good discussion this sub and the meme sometimes cause way better than seeing two casuals start insulting each other over comparing player googling stats can all have different opinion and still enjoy the game together haha ,0
except all the player from ,0

kilometer instead mile ,0
kyrie stayed and got would probably final favorite suck think about but hey thing could lot worse still love this team ,0
simmons more useful contender right now because better fit the nba got speed size and quickness and very high player too anyway already useful for every team the league you use him screening big houston contribute small ball five you put jokic houston team neither fit the fast pace westbrook nor the switch everything defence jokic never going quick and always going somewhat susceptible pnrs and isoing which you see tonne the nba ofc the counterargument jokic that good offence that worth changing your offensive system for but don think reached that level yet although the playoff looked like the best player the court most the time ,0
pretty sure said could similar not the same and also nothing confirmed until mri done ,0
self entitled fan man they think the salary make people inhuman ,0
think could take david stockton lol got hook shot and could post him ,0
always find thread like these funny where people are saying different player and then saying ,0
didn say wa major contributor hahah that wa the slipperysnail guy ,0
that nephew moment ,0
buddy one the most athletic and healthy player the league even lost some that athleticism would still elite his athleticism well still being top shooter buddy criminally underrated and need absolutely paid what deserves paid ,0
close please explain ,0
hope you enjoyed last year when the magic bounced wade and from the playoff how wa for you did you decide clipper fan that day ,0
mean this really the last place you should expect originality ,0
damn man you smash your grandma you guy can eskimo cousin ,0
how did you not realize that someone saying team with kawhi and will have shaky perimeter defense wa sarcasm ,0
but then the rest the game the crowd wa meh need for explain tho believe what you would like believe ,0
something something talking out your as ,0
you ,0
anybody who complains about harrison deal doesn actually understand ,0
simmons because the upside and the fast pace but very close ,0
mac knee back ,0
the best part the theme song the rest the sketch ,0
you the one trolling the magic unprovoked lol and yes magic will likely place above the heat again this year hate see ,0
tho ,0
but talking about how anyone can drop the nba not the rec think that his point although probably not quite accurate that actually not just that the worst nba player are better than the average viewer but that the skill level high just about anyone could put any night ,0
this man all ,0
ummm and blake who shot better than durant last season ,0
rekt ,0
this some non canon warcraft faction don think they were ,0
yeah said wa foot shorter ,0
they got good bigs neither whom can play the all and they got guard too they don have more wing than any other team ,0
don know who this man ,0
you know that the washington examiner right leaning biased newspaper that ha published false story look their false report the time before right google washington examiner credibility you don believe this get downvoted know just made bunch people butthurt ,0
le than game winning shot lol ,0
ha gilf fetish ,0
their best power forward theis and their best center kanter ,0
better than having guy out with stress fracture and injury the reason for load management not pointless wa purely about just being bit tired then guy would play every game ,0
why like fully guaranteed over year clear seen long term piece just not completely sure should considered part the core think like rozier contract with there some logic reason behind but overall probably not ideal ,0
unless you unemployed make and sell soap from local ingredient using hand made tool and equipment you probably make business with genocidal government every day lol know haven worked for single company lifetime that didn some way rely chinese manufacturing product market keep cost down and revenue and not even talking about big corporation either ,0
used shaq fan kid but watched the dwight howard dunk contest and loved him and then kinda stared following them during their run and just never looked the other way ,0
there are team that could use him but team that would want him with the price tag that attached his name ,0
lmao jokic wa legit mvp candidate this sound like someone who read the pre draft scouting report and nothing else ,0
kennard big factor too just because ha potential breakout given his skill set ,0
even sixer fan the answer and should probably jokic already probably one the best offensive big men all time not easy choice and getting into specific team will give you different answer but think you betting who ha better overall career jokic probably the better bet right now ,0
definitely maybe sometimes ,0
obviouswhitepersoncomment ,0
thing are different now with what happened team strong the lakers would have health top priority regular season game don matter much risk getting even worse injury even sit him out for longer just minimize the gamble and have the other guy gain confidence getting minute ,0
same response your other link you know that the washington examiner right leaning biased newspaper that ha published false story look their false report the time before right google washington examiner credibility you don believe ,0
not most improved half season award are given for the entirety the nba season ,0
live but like the clipper since they are the underdog and everyone wa laker fan growing same reason angel fan and not dodger fan ,0
imagining harden and jokic the same team defence would helpless entirely helpless ,0
lakers had all the talent the world and still beat you the final ,0
that before you take defence into account theis isn quick enough play lot team good player but bit tweeter between and nba kanter can guard pnr they closed with him hornet fancy our chance winning and awful ,0
not australian ,0
yes can give dolan fender telecaster some shit ,0
westy backbook ,0
yeah fair enough regarding initial comment concede wa pretty unconstructive tbh couldn really bothered explain the counter point because your initial comment came off like you wouldn listen anyone regardless what they said didn want waste time which ironic given this back and forth having now just wanted point out that you were wrong you know take you down few peg obviously didn work anything you dug your heel further dude again misinterpreting got what you meant the first time wa mainly the lmao part the end and the childish rephrasing comment that made give that response understood you intent and meaning fine read your last comment just cbf responding every point term this part for being smug with haven the slightest idea what you about wa the language you used let repeat you have fucking idea you misusing the fuck out you probably only ever seen the context this subreddit which imagine large reason for the downvotes that comment got one like that kind hubris and mean what this because feel you need you just can help yourself lol dunno just tone down you ain all that not either but felt like someone needed tell you ,0
didn cam have serious injury concern well thought that wa the biggest risk him draft day ,0
refusing show can the team suspend him without pay ,0
too ,0
and apparently only grade injury ,0
confirmation bias got ,0
agreed chinese representative answer human right violation uyghur tibet and hong kong ignore the question everytime and point some other fault another country and then counter argue and say china are dealing with terrorist and rioter when the government are the real terrorist that should tried for crime against humanity ,0
welcome the orlando magic ,0
johnson and johnson family company ,0
lmao you got jumped and got your as beat and your switch stolen hahahahahahahahahaha ,0
good news they now have ,0
this not looking good for morey ,0
that warrior team minus curry durant last year wa good enough make the playoff ,0
your personal experience defines all humanity got ,0
like see him finish his career philly they could use proven bench wing and philly already favorite come out the east ,0
ha one the more tragic story the nba wa the youngest ever nba mvp winner then got hit couple devastating knee injury that detailed entire season his career never fully recovered after that hard argue that many other player have have rougher few year than derrick rose ,0
the regular season think people overstate his offence wasn really the number one option late consistently only just dispelled question over his engine after his amazing playoff where became clear not only their but also their most reliable scorer andshooter because earlier the regular season had game where gassed out and brick airball floater hook shot late and the nugget are going finish top they should still trying make murray harris and maybe even mpj beasley take the reign late jokic can definitely the primary offence option late like showed when mattered the playoff but they need bit more help least for the first half the season think they try and give their guard chance they find themselves chance miss the playoff they through jokic the same level they did the playoff ,0
take simmons ,0
all kid dont know about ,0
actual question have seen you link this website lot did you make this really nice sorry just curious ,0
confused you have the same play twice plus barely cut the other two fact the last one drive the paint fall down then just get back and back into the corner before the turnover looking the right video ,0
analytics ha changed how analyze player usually for the better the high talent athletic guy still always high but priotizing analytically productive guy over guy who just look good now with influx international player the talent pool ha gotten deeper anecdotal but feel lot more team take the draft seriously now used that half the team the league didn focus much the draft and instead focused free agency with draft pick being trade bait small market team nowadays seems like every organization except few like the lakers and knicks really value the draft lot ,0
are you being intentionally lame ,0
that would lot fun watch the game far there have been few time that lonzo and kenrich williams have picked their man full court ,0
miss this guy and his hustle all the time ,0
zion fun watch guy with complete control his body fan ,0
,0
bad meant say team pas wa going sign watch the rocket don know that make difference ,0
wow that wild ,0
gone bro just like hope kawhi ,0
wa problem when our summer league team played these highlight don surprise one bit ,0
season doesn start until christmas day game anyway ,0
what you guy give this year think guy ,0
lol the last video just mix the first two according the nba stats page http stats nba com player shooting season seasontype regular season wa step back good for which actually basically the same his normal anyways regardless that feel like super low value shot for poor shooter taking ,0
better call saul nba nephew http youtu wqnhtggvaue ,0
because wasn very good player overall not worth the cap space alot fan really overvalue rose because what used have front office now that way smarter than that ,0
the bull did put pressure him but let fair said wanted pain free for meeting after retired doesn sound like guy that wa all the team ,0
aren all ,0
not australian but lived sydney for six month lived there the year before simmons wa drafted there wa hype around him but not much else had league pas that how watched ball knowledge and budget channel would play nba game experience over all ,0
yeah had hip surgery but from everything him the sun and the tar heel have said about appears the surgery wa done something corrective that wa done improve his athleticism shouldn knock against him idk what that mean but they always seem downplay and say wasn due injury and not big deal ,0
yeah kinda forgot about how lucky they were get that pick still you look the return other star that wanted traded lately kyrie twice kawhi etc the pelican got one the best return package can remember ,0
fun fact also the highest game score modern nba history ,0
thought the nba wa boring saw vince carter dunk boom became raptor fan ,0
get that the preseason clearly you don preseason should only repeat only used for evaluating young talent possible rotation and new offensive defensive focus play and minute management ,0
favourite player but giannis with steph shooting overpowered fuck ,0
ledecline ,0
why would you root for rapist the last player who deserves ,0
this the correct answer ,0
this pretty much for this guy either turn around this season bust that probably won get signed anywhere ,0
hospital ,0
sun playoffbound ,0
mention think about how easy steph make look get his shot off now make him inch taller not that simple curry and durant have amazing handle which vital getting shot off nba defense joke and big men who can cover the perimeter are becoming more and more common even without curry handle off ball movement and playmaking ability curry jumpshot will still have huge impact giannis game but definitely not much the hand curry himself who can use it fullest potential ,0
percent speaking from experience cause love frank much another universe the face the nba ,0
yeah only heard that story couple four dozen time drop the wolf and never look back buck nation the way ,0
wasn mchale bad defender ,0
the best center the league ,0
rose cool character ,0
think you and others are underestimating how wide skill set jordan had wa elite play maker you basically saying that you take the best player all time and add the best point shot his game that giannis somehow better just don see go ,0
what boneheaded joke make just few year removed from the ultra controversial king lakers series ,0
,0
that doesn mean they make ray machine ,0
shaq would pretty good ,0
the way ha reinvented his image amazing young people now have idea how stifled tech the past ,0
this guy get the show ,0
what weird stupid faux humble quote guarantee rose did not think this after scoring just trying pat himself the back roundabout way ,0
miss watching pre injury rose play such amazing talent ,0
have league pas and have for most season the last but the past watched illegal stream watched duke like the coverage lot espn ha lot and have relative with sky duke show few week which super cool for free channel then league pas doesn have blackout for area like the can see every single game which great play basketball all those friend least little bit then out other friend have couple friend who are big fan like few more that are casuals then the other half have real interest ,0
well duh you playing the best league the world with the best player the world ,0
yeah but tanking team also rest player and sub third stringer lose individual game towards the end the season that basically throwing game imo but get what you guy are saying ,0
step back split are known for being inaccurate guy ,0
you mean the core the team that won game ,0
they are patriotic enough lot american are willing spend ,0
started watching bball wa like only one team had three all star one them wa shorter rather unathletic white guy like obviously cavs for life wa only year misery until picked lbj ,0
insane that beat out the jazz magic pacer and thunder team that had many chance historically and the thunder who had the talent run though the decade just few year ago ,0
know wa just saying had pair those shoe kept from back the day lol ,0
lmaoooooooooooo made one bruh ,0

james harden ,0
true but also have take into account wa accused rape that mix well not exactly rooting for the guy ,0
you purposely play weak roster with the fore knowledge that the team will likely lose then you are throwing the game ,0
he modern kenny anderson ,0
japan make ton instrumentation equipment general ,0
like the team and feel like taking le will keep their core intact why not his life isn going change make million versus million ,0
hmmm think simmons ha higher ceiling but jokic could end the better player when their career are done risk simmons ,0
could use him and another big ,0
last night ,0
respect you putting all this effort hope hayward ha mega bounce back season ,0
that defence would helpless too tbh lol ,0
doubt they have amazing handle but giannis isn terrible any mean can run the pick and roll well without real jumper and especially transition doe good job getting past player but didnt mean that would able hit the same style curry but also wouldn have lot taller stronger and more athletic even than ,0
could get you bro ,0
thought wa old pirate ,0
intentionally constructing roster that designed lose game how that different than throwing game ,0
somebody called trae that too ,0
honestly should gone the doctor china they way more chill with stem cell type therapy ,0
jesus man only handful player have ever done that season ,0

throughout history ha been the inaction those who could have acted the indifference those who should have known better the silence the voice justice when mattered most that have made possible for evil triumph mlk you can get the fuck out here with invoking that kerr justified for refusing even say objectively evil government evil when asked about because those useless victim don affect him directly sure got ,0
zion looked better exhibition game than luka rookie season where actual nba minute were played the answer obvious zion ,0
already have luka favorite team and very happy with that ,0
completely forgot about this pretty cool see honestly ,0
anyone else seeing ton blatant attempt smooth over this problem acting like none big deal anymore yeah adam silver definitely doing this took the massive backlash from his initial statement supporting china over freedom speech his true belief then instructed every coach player nba representative who questioned about this the exact same thing which give non answer figure obvious nba people will give real answer the topic then eventually this will die off will viewed yesterday news that isn big deal and people will forget about and back praising him ,0

well using that logic then any comment about foreign nation would verboten the protest began when carrie lam chief executive pushed amendment extradition bill the amendment woul have allowed resident tried the mainland many most resident want tried for crime not the mainland that because defendant who removed from will far from family support indeed our own amended reflects this fact requiring trial the district where the crime alleged have been committed the protester wanted the bill pulled and wa however carrie lam original intransigence led greater demonstration course can tell you the demand each every protestor but the demand have mushroomed beyond the original opposition the extradition bill amendment now include anger the fact that the prc playing greater role affair than wa originally imagined ,0

see chinese communism system which frequently disagree with more than one which see immoral much the same way that while disagree with bos political view don find him immoral person don like the recent trend labeling every thing which you find disagreeable immoral think dangerous approach reality and will cause more harm than good the long run think much more reasonable accept that china and hong kong have some issue they need work out and trust that they can adult enough work out those problem their own china literally start running over these protester with tank you can have your morality argument but right now this internal dispute much like often have the ,0
troll ,0
the poor multi millionaire stand lose small percentage realistically about their income are danger losing their livelihood total fucking nonsense saying that the nba stand lose billion which even the worst projection still not even close being true morey didn place the nba negative public limelight the nba bending over backwards appease regime that rival the evil nazi german placed negative limelight ,0

wonder what happens with the rotation given how good naw ha been ,0
carmelo simmons with the sway ,0
dude tank sort like mini with lebron with le finesse but more strength lebron wa strong and better built compared the rookie but think zion ha him beat that category ,0
dont think he better than kyrie but would put him over kemba you put simmons team built like the buck and gave him superstar usage then could maybe average triple double his stats while embiid sits are amazing ,0
unfortunately the history both country are fraught with human right abuse for decade american treatment people our southern border ha been horrific for century our treatment the indigenous population ha been horrific the point genocide these people saying that there comparison categorically false the point shouldn shy away from one example country with jan right abuse bash another should condemn the act both and what you american advocate that your government break with their abuse the past people get too their feeling you truthfully point out the fault our own system that necessitate change can fix our problem while saying another country ha issue well fixing those issue even just advocating that they addressed make you the exact opposite hypocrite ,0
,0
why ,0
turner ha very little chance being better than joel embiid ,0
idk think alright ,0
you surprised ,0
good call update the data ,0
just clear that wasn opinion rather that wa more early impression what people will say regardless whether true not mean every single top player ha fuckwits saying stupid shit about them that patently false some example lebron not clutch and suck defense harden all good flopping and getting free throw giannis literally only dunk westbrook stat padder that doesn care about winning doesn play defense curry can only shoot three kawhi ballhog and always hurt etc etc etc and for the record these aren making thing this all shit that either seen here before heard from dumbass coworkers colleague that have idea what they talking about simmons fix the actual issue his gameplay for the most part willing bet that still see people making stuff discredit him ,0
think that stepping try and cause change your country easier than trying change thing authoritarian country the other side the world when athlete speak out about the plight their country stem from often growing community that suffer the similar situation witness them daily yes it all cynical business but they least have chance something their own country morey making one tweet doesn make one iota difference how the chinese will approach the hong kong situation trying get every coach the league start shit with china change nothing what you want about are you going sign for the military and petition the government wage war with china liberate the hong kong people it hard stomach and it not exactly nice think about but there very little that can done about this situation and weighing doesn anything all ,0
suddenly not easy isn when it coming out your own pocket keep talking and act like you actually did something lol ,0
between bender and chriss actually looking like serviceable nba player all sudden sun fan must pissed ,0

lot people bring kaepernick like putting your career the line especially for profession you love common easy thing for people doesn help that yao ming the biggest connection between the nba and china isn showing some support for hong kong bring this not blast yao ming because obviously being citizen and major face for mainland china unlikely make such unpopular move simply want make the point that without figure head and face get thing motion unlikely something this foreign both figuratively and literally would spark the kind fire that would motivate player people want call steve kerr hypocrite but considering his past with his father have little doubt mind more than just talk when come the issue discussed the past opinion with issue like hong kong you going make political stand can just soundbites this how you get stuck all the chatter that muddies the conversation with little action ,0

his involvement with china peripheral best living working travelling playing with someone daily basis and potentially having formed strong social and personal bond with them over the course year decade and closely understanding interacting with their culture and experience nowhere near the same visiting country for exhibition game once year and corresponding business marketing matter occasionally while having lot fan that like your team the nba wa comprised majority chinese player throughout kerr life you would have point but stand you simply dunce ,0

shut the hell one against human right you twisting word around the freedom not engaged every political issue only political issue your choosing just important the freedom speak out against human right issue this idea that every athlete the nba absolutely need use their platform address this issue ridiculous ,0
are you sure that would confined blue state not one the enduring talking point people bring when talking about the current state our politics well least tough china ,0

you even need jump shot when you built like concrete bowling ball ,0
give everyone plenty ammo when they try push their political ideology upon people again kaepernick admitted never voted his life openly supported castro sued his employer the ground solving problem before settled for peanut away and still supported the majority nfl beyond frustrating how people ignore every fault just focus the one thing they like ,0
other word the side you now the side you for historical conflict the same people who use weasel word defend china are the same who defend the nazi and support slavery the end the day human life just don mean whole lot for them ,0

know all want our player take stand here but this point see this them supporting david silver right now there are lot angle this and eventually going come down his decision making once acted the player may disagree and choose say something but until then anything they say will only make his job harder they trust silver and the top guy have his back until otherwise ,0
what the frick zigxy thought were friend ,0
hongkonger really wish the nba star would speak and support like how they support black right and woman right however you definitely not need any knowledge chinese history know that morey ha the freedom speak his mind this response from curry tell that trying spin the question you support morey freedom speech into you support hong kong that not good look ,0

not arguing the potential ramification the bill agree that the bill unprecedented nature and need revised and revisited before can codified agree that the extraordinarily short day public review period proposed carrie lam outrageous considering china ha not established itself fair arbiter justice for extradition agree that the court should have more say determining who get extradited case case basis instead having that power rest solely with the chief executive agree that this step the wrong direction for given the current judicial environment the prc started this whole conversation shine light how much background there really and how unreasonable expect steph curry know this much about what the protest are about why the protest are occurring and why both china and might feel upset about what each view violation their respective sovereignty doesn matter that you think the poon hiu wing case trojan horse the fact remains that this case being used establish legal precedent and that make the case relevant ,0
how the heck are smaller than tampa lmao ,0

maybe and steph are close but think lbj eclipse everyone the biggest name sport ,0
what steph lebron speaking out going the very least will keep the issue relevant instead being forgotten after few highlight play and drama the league keep the news and incite more outrage that come point where actually beneficial for the corporation this case the nba cut tie with china you wanted practical instead arguing purely out ideology right there your practical answer right now pretty much the argument against demoralize dissuade discussion annoying keep hearing about this you don really care but what can you just forget about there finally big commotion regarding the issue and opportunity for something actually come out hope people keep the fire burning ,0
you are playing blaskowitz then see problem there ,0
one the most liberal city the they took the sign because that arena policy capital one political protest sign anything like that ,0

fuck that sure would sacrifice the league for closing the concentration camp the and china heartbeat but the league folding due stupid tweet will nothing the sort ,0
china the very least relevant the nba though you have rumor about cap guy calculating possible change cap space because this whole shitshow doesn that imply that directly affect the league another perspective instead saying that look how much the league will lose how about look how much the league actually profiting off it relationship with china don know why keep being framed the former ,0

maybe because you attract people who share the same interest yourself not saying young people don like the nfl just that resonates more with boomer and above most likely due the conservative politics the league hence the popularity the south and manly nature millennials aren nfl crazy you can feel the youth online when talking about nba the nfl ,0

dude this societal problem right now and becoming dangerous and terrifying basically you aren speaking out against something you are obviously for that hardly ever the entire story social medium ha made everyone can voice their opinion moment notice and doesn even have well researched opinion but doesn matter because you still get attention and praise for because you spoke out but you stay silent somehow mean you aren against that thing that bullshit incredibly damaging our society perfectly just say don know and not the one ask absolutely support the right for lgbt people whatever they want their personal life and with their body but not going post about really ever bring conversation because straight white male with nothing add but there people now who say silence mean don support them there people now who say because didn add the whatever when wrote lgbt earlier mean don support them and take the niem ller poem heart think our responsiblity speak when called upon support each other and make each other feel accepted and safe but maybe shutting the fuck give air for someone who actually part that group speak for themselves maybe opinion shiouldn the one that matter when not the one being discriminated against trampled government and your point these are athlete fucking sad that have stooped low that are concerned with the thought celebrity like you said there not single word that bron steph could say that going turn shit around and you one the one waiting with bated breath speak make sure you doing something help those people too ,0

his anticipation passing and spacing are every bit good better then what lebron had rookie can handle well but maybe you didn watch this dude pas the ball jump passing lane dude truly don think physically you could any quicker better period not saying lebron but you literally listed thing that zion doe well anyone ha ever done and hasn even played real game kid got ton work his mid and long range game those are the point you should have hit because the stuff you are saying wack ,0
there are chinese fan the arena you can tell them wearing long lion jersey the issue could instantly escalate there wa little exchange word let them hear about the airport somewhere else the game should peaceful and entertaining environment ,0
those same fan are the people who would suffer lebron speaks against china that the side people demanding him shit china don think about people only bring lebron side losing money but not chinese fan being cut off from seeing their favorite player play ,0

sorry and maybe the cynic but this isn issue about not standing for every cause this issue that boil down money every figure the nba play their public image the nba ha been playing the public image game for year that why allen iverson wa such controversial figure that why the nba instituted dress code after malice the palace but bullshit that these beloved public figure will sit here like kerr pop lebron while making million dollar and easily speak out against donald trump they should boost their image given easily low hanging fruit but when their revenue the line all sudden hush themselves morey and the nba shouldn have backtrack from the situation ,0

let summarize help them accept that one tweet from get his team banned the statement from silver don control everything our employee tweet their private account get the whole league banned and reaction that nobody ha opinion that right can follow this logic all about diplomacy and understanding but once they decide collectively punish team and the whole league just because one individual voiced opinion that isn regime confirmatory this drastic manner about time take stand the damage done and everything magnitude that would change that wouldn mean teaching them something beyond their current approach but exactly playing into those aspect that make the china today huge liability don want dispute their potential and don want glorify the west but can censor ourselves this degree appease regime like this can slave their insanity ,0

don support the protest whatsoever however this longer about the protest but rather about the slippery slope self censorship and compromising core american value matter you are liberal conservative liberatarian socialist think can all agree that the first amendment important issue have seen many video regarding nba china and nba player china and can see that they are fervent and dedicated any american fan genuinely heartbroken for the chinese fan who face the prospect losing the nba yes they can always stream the game but imagine being banned from wearing your team jersey when you out not being able buy gear being shut out the nba community and relegated the outside looking but have agree with max sa twisting himself pretzel only circle back time and again but money though whataboutism sa regarding rosa park and arab israeli conflict both cringey especially given talking jew the comparison don make sense later video sa remark that common people are never expected comment the arab israeli conflict other world issue true but fails recognize that the ha intimate relationship with china and morey comment are therefore more relevant that regard http www youtube com watch xeagpi http www youtube com watch xeagpi will defer tsai regard his understanding chinese society however trying force american apologize for exercising free speech tantamount third rail issue american politics ,0

this first four year lebron played first round game michael jordan played you can act like entire fourth the potential game are ridiculous but not every year the playoff that between game difference you averaging ppg then that point difference per year that extra point differential between jordan and lebron because the difference year point advantage large when talking about point that like twelfth the total lebron already his season michael scored approximately point le than lebron the playoff that mean lebron had extra season but that doesn give context either because lebron also had more game per playoff conclusion yeah make difference like wtf how you think that doesn count not mention including playoff total doesn make sense because give you negative for ending series earlier like the warrior scored more per game than the warrior the playoff but also played fewer game should the warrior get accolade for scoring more total point that dumb ,0

but when come taking public stand something controversial you don get point for recanting only because pressure from your job pressure from you job ought expected posted message about fight for freedom but then apologized the second his job pressured him even though would have unlimited job prospect within and outside the nba the rocket were fire him yeah losing your job suck regardless but taking stand doesn only mean taking stand long you can keep your job ,0

yea kevin love still ,0
melo ha run from that make him absolute first ballot hofer paul george greatest moment wa dunking birdman windmill the clipper love and such beast offensenand defense but melo undeniably better career melo just underrated because how the last year played out had great year career and all time great ,0
actually like that core lot question mark but hard what make interesting ,0
thank you for believing ,0

aerodynamics ,0
how you think the knicks build dynasty from here draft big trade lucky signing dsj knox robinson interesting core ,0
even with klay they have huge size disadvantage can handle and mcgee the same time the lakers offensive rebound will devastating ,0
wow those are nice ,0
mean but atleast having some center would helped wcs looney and smailagic were all out and pretty sure those are literally the tallest player the roster ,0
well just have make into lob contest choose your two player got smart and timelord ,0
this sub make lot more sense when you remember that nobody actually watch the game this shot ha always been money for fultz let see free throw any set shot where actually ha think about what doing ,0
looked like that time year ago somewhat smooth when would shoot turnaround something similar rhythm anytime wa set all like catch and shoot with the obvious free throw issue his mechanic would allll over the place ,0
hear out get the exact opposite and see what sun magic final would ,0
luka and will the goat ,0

blow mind that were point where lebron look weird with headband ,0
wait till they find out john middle name ,0
basically john wall ,0
gone halftime ,0
get that acknowledged that several time also don think that impactful for team that had top offence and defence last year and hasn created any easily exploitable hole for itself losing him like pat connaughton also contributed positively last year dropped him without replacing him with comparable player would also worse but guarantee people wouldn losing their shit about how much mistake losing pat connaughton wa brogdon most certainly lot better than connaughton but the idea remains the same isn good people think our system coaching and depth strong enough that can approximate much his value through other player the team and not yet mentioned this conversation but still relevant likely improve other area through other acquisition and progression from young player the impact brogdon leaving going minimal ,0
yee yeeeeeee ,0
wikipedia say barkley played throughout his career agree that will better for zion slim down little bit just for his own joint with how explosive but lot people this thread are acting like fat that boy all muscle ,0
list melos nba accomplishment from and doesn stack comparison melo ha longevity argument and that better virtually everything other than scoring than prime melo his advanced stats say this his career accolade say this his playoff accomplishment say this ,0
the headassery unstoppable ,0
your feeling are hurt someone online chat room good good saying both you wa talking you directly stuckinperpetuity cry bunch people over the internet people like him will eliminated from existence soon lol please who exactly ,0
number draft pick markelle fultz ,0

hairodynamics ,0
man that just sound only depressing fuck thats disturbing and china far along with advancement their economy technology and military that going take hundred year even begin reversing getting rid that regime and can really happen unless they start war with the would take many resource even attempt slowly changing the structure their government that too risky for even first world country anything that whats scarier about china than russia the impression have about russian citizen for the most part understand what putin whether they agree with his policy not are another thing but china these people literally not because how tyrannical their leader are with information fuck ,0
for sure man but they aren locking anybody down out there dominating anyway all that meant ,0
take the under him playing game ,0
dude all nba about overall impact yes considering ha more all nba then yes doe make for the defensive team jesus are you one those people who think all nba strictly about offense ,0
looney perfectly capable defensive center but that about lol ,0
think they trying make their primary uniform like the cowboy white jersey ,0
several interesting quote here had the lineup with gary and jamal and paul and wa there jokic said were just moving and cutting just didn know what told him when you standing you wrong whatever you just move that exactly what malone ha told him move the ball gotta understand cutting through the lane and finishing that cut and spotting back because the ball will find you malone said that just how play really good shooter can post guy can guy really talented player jokic said didn have player like that just size wise last year you can see attacking the basket just going the ball like bullying people gonna really good porter know his court development work progress which why unlikely get the starting small forward job his defense must improve substantially and his feel for his new role will take time ,0
you are talking about career accomplishment not skillset quit trying move the goalpost when that all defense argument isn working ,0
there virtually argument for melo over the advanced stats say this career accolade say this ,0
watched most the game dwight for the most part running down the court well and playing good defense look like the best shape his life physically showed some sign the rebounding and defensive force used there were like play though where completely black holed offense and ended with really bad shot that something watch but the rest the game looked move the ball and just waited for his opportunity catch lob open lane ,0
sure doe ,0
the their option hurt wanted suit isnt allowed too right now though ,0
survived the showtime lakers and kobe lakers invincible ,0
most important measurement are height weight and girth ,0
also would start dribbling game like had handle but became quickly obvious that only got the one move ,0
wanna spice rock paper scissors add fourth item that beat two the original and only get beat one introduces actual strategy into the game ,0

did you read other comment did you just parrot the same take without thinking lol ,0
melo the better rebounder look his orb and much much better scorer melo the better playmaker considering how much better scoring than george and how little they both pas melo also had the best playoff year either them would argue the only thing george ha him defense every single advanced stat going drop for george too unless retires the next year two get those out here way ha george had better career than melo though not close all ,0

hello welcome nba ,0
god yes minute giannis dissecting him choking the playoff lol ,0
are you old enough remember the context behind melo just wa the face syracuse championship team march madness before getting drafted everyone loved him saying wa overhyped because wade and lebron show understanding the context who melo wa wa more famous than dwade then wa the best pure scorer the nba for the better part year just looking stats doesn account for the fact that the game ha changed over the year the context behind their bucket ,0
this genuinely would make happy everyone need little pick from time time and boban hug would just that ,0

cannot believe that court say san francisco one baseline ,0
steph and dlo are about close dlo and jerian grant ,0
nah get and know had several these type discussion with you and nothing too stupid but not your take that are annoying even when disagree the many many people acting like this the end the franchise like can get past philly without brogdon like wa our second best player any point beyond literally one six game series that this why giannis will leave etc that just totally baffle wish all our role player got that kind favourable judgement ,0
accolade number stats back your opinion ,0
luca ,0
context doesn save you here nope tell what melo ha done his career better than besides score ,0
weirdo like this need professional help ,0
yeah superstar indisputably superstar ,0
lmao okay without him ,0

guessing wiggins the corner cry ,0
spur aldridge and derozan ,0
nonsense the lakers had ton turmoil they overcame the beginning ingram and rondo were suspended for month after the game against the rocket they played west playoff team non stop start the only east team they faced wa toronto and trip florida during that half the season denver wa the seed gsw portland lal lac spur okc can remember who wa but the final standing ended being gsw denver portland houston utah okc spur and the clipper ,0
love this lol ,0

almost only played game the last month ,0
these deep fake video are starting get good ,0
yeah man and lbj really comparable drose played game two season row before last lebron ha been iron man most his career also with the two them one miss week two the lakers still have the best player the court against most team the league also point you don know injury going occur it just weak point general you can knock and lbj talent you have say well what they get injured come off real wishful thinking more than anything imo ,0
all stats that are going down for george career progress not mention advanced stats aren the end all argument lol and that massive difference when come orb get you have your opinion and you don want listen other people but being hostile you are only make you look like idiot ,0
smailagic our secret weapon bruh keep sleeping ,0
muh dick ,0

smailagic you made name for that third center wouldn know warrior are fielding some leaguers out there ,0
twitter full absolute idiot set great screen and had all around decent game hit his bucket once get the flow the offence ,0
for them the schedule wa way harder the beginning because not only wa the schedule tough but they were brand new team they had figured out their lineup and had rhythm going december and that wa getting them relatively easy win until christmas after that their whole starting lineup got injured one after the other ,0
all out here actin like melo wasn starter like season ago like been washed for season now come pull the stats for melo circa come out favoring george too ,0
,0
edit bad thought who had the biggest gap not the smallest ,0
jazz spida and gobert maybe conley could even contend the best player the jazz ,0

yea not sure what all the hype around this michael jordan guy some old fart the wizard getting compared lebron james smh ,0
hmm http medium tenor com image bfd ddcf tenor gif ,0
mean klay exists but yeah danny awesome ,0
hood collins collins ha shown his defensive chop all season and performed well the playoff with increased minute against one the better front court the nba don think hood particularly good defensively all but trust him enough hopefully funnel the ball handler collins whiteside because that pretty much all ask our guard combo forward ,0
look like really struggling get much lift his jump and that wa far his most valuable talent when wa his prime hard see how can that valuable can jump anymore but think doing good job being veteran big man who know where and how avoid fouling hopefully his body loosens the season progress ,0
what doe being starter have with anything maybe you should look more than just advanced stats considering clear you have never watched melo actually play ,0
good luck with that ,0
when the hell did the lakers pick daniel ,0
who better while selectively excluding accomplishment give break what you want all say wa better ,0
fair enough didn really think that ,0
this clip pretty saturated not that bright ,0
this wa posted like month ago but for some reason it not anymore the answer wa andre miller with pretty random ,0
that second line super important drew brees alvin kamara michael thomas etc are loved and basically worshipped new orleans large part because how much they embraced the city zion and this pelican team whole for that matter ha embraced the city way that the player organization didn the past that why there much excitement around the team this year even though don consider the pelican championship contender yet ,0
yeah wa going say help playing along side and ross who both had pretty good night ,0
kemba pretty clearly better than tatum until tatum show otherwise ,0
they can build off this ,0
nick young look the same way when dribble ,0
amazing you getting upset statement and opinion that you fucking garbage and that for the sake the global community you and others alike are better off just having your existence terminated ,0
nah think toxic redditors like you are the worst you too obtuse even understand what wa just literally explained you please stop commenting your reply are gonna the quality your last two ,0

talkin bout practice ,0
you accept the greatness when you see and move think frank vogel next pop ,0

markelle fultz got jimmy ,0
roy wa never credibly accused gang rape admitted court that doesn know what consent rose doesn belong anywhere near the same sentence roy ,0
yah saying what doe everyone expect like monster regardless but tonight towered over the whole team the warrior only had starter that can defend bigs draymond ,0
people who defend him saying can fault man for loving his kid wish dad wa that invested really miss the shade abuse like there aren multiple way shit bloke ,0
can anyone explain what going here that look like shot someone who doesn even lay basketball could make ,0
yes agree but then again who would have though lakers would have such great lineup mcagee kuzma dwight king james and prince that just unheard mean they could give tough time even bull and serious ,0
comfortably take over gallo ,0
spanky panky time davis ,0
number overall draft pick who seeming out nowhere developed hitch his shot and couldn shoot been training for year and now seems like can shoot nba hype for his potential you think this weird wait till ben simmons hit his first three pointer going nut ,0
been sport team before never did sing alongs before the season lol however did other team building activity ,0
yea until the youngest ball out ball them all ,0
not top nba player ,0
not hating the man just his victimized fanbase ,0
boo fucking hoo you got lebron and ,0
isn stated his contract must defend steph like your last ,0
wa here ,0
about with shoe when people usually guessed around ,0
talking about shit franchise when your team can ever win back back lmao and who ha more ring top player and didn top player just abandon your team and win elsewhere you talking about anthony davis and lebron who are top player the league when your best player are demar derosan and aldridge lmaoooo spur fan are sad ,0
love the fact that people are still complaining about that lol ,0
yeah their highest returning scorer are marvin williams and cody zeller who both had ppg last season their roster look pretty rough ,0
lesser deal are you high lakers fan crack ,0
your side this there doubt that while melo all time great scorer that really where his excellence end his career around which basically league average for the time played defensively had net negative dbpm nearly his entire career and that largely confirmed the eye test well wa solid rebounder but the expense ditching his assignment snag several the defensive board however wa excellent offensive rebounder think during his prime especially new york would have excelled had more stable point guard run the offense off the top head played with felton lin and prigioni and while all had their moment none could provide the playmaking shooting ability and perimeter defense you need paired next melo seems like most people arguing for melo only bring counting stats support their thesis club all star and ppg which all them are either subjective not tell the full story case for paul george that nearly every category excluding scoring far superior first the defensive end all start with willingness one the most willing defender have the league creates deflection and steal and among the league leader both category year year out this end the floor sturdy rebounder well grabbing defensive rebound for his career george can also guard and ha done several occasion when needed the attack level above melo efficiency which the name the game this point hit peak this past season scoring volume while doubt can top this given the multitude option wouldn say ppg out the question this season healthy also steady creator the offense though will never the primary assist man any team willing passer and know when look for his shot defer another overall george ha the more complete game that fluid enough adapt any situation ,0
young player who wa the first pick the draft but his first two season the league were not good because seemed like forgot how shoot something and his form looked terrible but from wikipedia his ailment wa later described thoracic outlet syndrome tos the neurogenic type the disorder which affect nerve between the neck and shoulder resulting abnormal functional movement and range motion thus severely limiting markelle ability shoot basketball guess nba just want see this kid comeback and live the hype that made him the first overall draft pick also kind meme see him hit jumper ,0
which one should avoid ,0
thought espn fucked the er name first when saw this matchup ,0
think tatum will close the gap bit offense and kembas difficulty defense will make pretty close this year but guess you pay closer attention them than ,0
meant for how last season went but okay ,0
zeller and bacon guess idk ,0
hoe mad ,0
thank you for being polite ,0
but believe thomas bryant going look really good maybe even for mip ,0
this stupid ask question ask convinced out his answer the question which wa not question because post shit and then try bash everyone that tell him otherwise first comparing career when one isn over stupid then every stupid question like this one depends what you mean how you judge better career cause what see from here just you wanting dis melo with question like you even start with olympic shit lmao don know what make better career let you the useless talk about how ha more than melo and how melo ha more than from what you wrote stats are close for the player that given the difference context can mean shit melo seems have more individual trophy but career isn over then saw you talk about playoff success both have none they went conf final thats all you can say you want compare you would have account for context and would once again endless useless talk what can got from this nothing for anyone with brain cause they would already know that the question and your way ask stupid but you could understand that you ask question just say your answer this what you would get what you want and downvotes you least have explanation for that now you really want answer make other post state how you define the criterion for career value and ranking then you have discussion but you only went here attempt for validation you clearly don want listen people they don say the same you are edit funny how would claim that all these downvoted but nobody can tell how melo ha had better career than but post wa downvoted after wa posted but with what wrote defenitly can right ,0
aaaand gone ,0
you are correct thanks that year know for sure that wa very early morning measurement wa near max height probably drop late day ,0
mcgruder shudder ,0
imo aswell point god all know this but the dantoni offense requires the particular seven second type style first look harden good enough slow the game down and run half set need fulfilling what did there but rus fit better into the fast pace philosophy antoni more naturally then did the big thing imo off ball movement which been okay with early his career but got worse with think that all about putting the hardwork change the habit built but can ,0
literally just chose some the guard matched with the most across possession yeah and you understand there very clear bias here right simmons isn matching often against the guard struggle against when looking kemba most frequent matchup rajon rondo held eric bledsoe held averaged for the season aaron fox held guess your logic should putting kemba curry hasn shown that capacity because hasn been assigned kemba full time all specifically because sixer team the past needed have redick guard the small player get bullied the bigger one against team like charlotte this isn really concern all they run plenty smaller guard match redick onto redick right between lamb and monk ,0
yeah for sure they lose the warrior and the probably the buck also with butler this theoretical playoff ,0
wa not even after dame replied the first time lol actually wrote good bar shaq some grade school rap shit but that where rap now guess people ,0
mean have you heard the history nba player trying rap not that hard for him ,0
wa your second best player the playoff played literally series bro ,0
the ceiling the roof ,0
ha alienated his team and demanded trade yet ,0
people forget what did for the sun gave phoenix world series too ,0
did but wa the last game the regular season and weird stuff always happens then for the season put while being arguably the worst defensive player the nba that not worth much ,0
are you trying say rare that team after losing two integral piece championship roster won blow get ahead rebuild happens all the time and there merit doing ,0
scramble for africa electric boogaloo ,0
the mavs won lol ,0
nope wa tyson ,0
erdogan shit gulen shit don know why you can dislike more then one person gulen goon literally fired civilian and dropped bomb http www youtube com watch umsn wpvy even tho erdogan bad this the person you want support and more importantly creates political division which fruitless people only counter with the gulen argument they more interested creating chaos than they are interested solving issue hahhahah north american are complacent that they would literally support the reincarnation hitler said fuck trump pick your friend wisely because gulen and erdogan are two apple from the same tree and case could made that gulen worse and yes say that the stalin wa bad that mean that actually nazi supporter great logic why didn polish people just choose side when both side wanted them subjugated and oppressed ,0
think the point favor jarrett allen that much more important the future the franchise the net won full gear until year from now when kevin durant come back and complete lack any kind lateral movement make him liability lot matchup never good look when the best way attack the opposing team center pick and roll boston going struggle with that after replacing horford with kanter ,0
think the comment the toronto player made that kawhi played with such calmness and confidence helped buoy them when they might otherwise succumb mental pressure not sure butler can provide that course spur fan have bit dislike kawhi but can deny that ha really worked hard lot facet his game and improved each year adding new facet such think there bit daylight between kawhi and butler kwahi had great supporting cast especially light the player missing from the warrior lineup and role player like van fleet really stepped and made huge difference ,0
capela especially defensively ,0
literally wasn the second option though never been high volume player because pass any remotely contested shot that why efficient ,0
people are too lazy fact check here they just assume lot thing repeat false narrative they seen posted before why you see lot garbage being upvoted their assumption truth being upvoted must true only take five second check that rubio the mid and nudged just few season ago ,0
have thinking melo and stoudimer spelling and what not going back into etc but yeah the knicks suck sack lately everybody want according the medium lol nobody doe ,0
what the point scientist saving the world can watch jimmy get bucket ,0
but set standard ,0
marc did too ,0
agreed curry would sick any team curry can spot and shoot from anywhere and create his own shot when need bad rather have him team with passer like magic lebron opposed jordan ,0
his flaw that know his limit and stay within them that why basically only take wide open three which why his point shooting kinda overrated and ha low point attempt ratio tbh too conservative player ever become star imo but very good role player ,0
could see fultz big good role player and feel they can compete the east the magic trading for lowry that raptor get some decent amount pick return instead letting him walk free ,0
imagine gotta annoying disliking gulenists for long time and now being called paid erdogan shill you bring ,0
love everything about this ,0
ghana ,0
wade spoken about how they cruised the regular season they just knew they were better man ,0
trez ,0
aaaye see you bro ,0
massive improvement late and includes decent above average midrange shot well just set shot with open look don think will enough ,0
you measure nfl player cleat literally creates standard measurement idk why anyone would opposed that ,0
better player the heat the reason ,0
could beat your test score with lazy tutor and the substitute teacher squad ,0
beverly shamet george kawhi harrell and zubac center that helluva line ,0
backed with evidence where where very well chronicled ,0
why selling the jersey issue wasn free once dropped out ,0
shoot from three because only take wide open shot his ratio low guy only took wide open most could probably shoot over well defense average ,0
not trying hard during the regular season because you know you are more talented than other team ,0
,0
wait you gonna leave without ,0
celtic severely need rim protector capela ,0
but harden better win chip lmao ,0
damn forgot actually won that crazy ,0

woosh ,0
sun are least favorite team the league but rubio and saric are perfect pick ups ,0
seth curry wa unfortunate loss for and probably our biggest out the one you mentioned aminu wa loss but not unrecoverable however losing turner not that bad loved the dude but really did not like watching him shoot unreliable turnaround midrange fadeaway jumper every game plus the addition na little will take some turner minute and will able develop that young talent meyers leonard wa not loss for all either only played mpg and contributed three pointer game his minute will absorbed collins and whiteside two player who would far rather want play intead the relatively long term member that core who went the conf final were not significant contributor and think actually improved our roster term impactful player from last year now chemistry course question but for the lakers clipper sixer etc this year well ,0

omg wow dame dolla with the ,0
curious probably won travel toronto again this year right ,0
point that knowing perimeter defense weakness lillard and mccollum not sure bazemore will enough replace the loss turner and aminu collins isn great but project your starting and whiteside your starting you have defense your backcourt and shooting your frontcourt with question mark the wing depth love stotts and think can make work but there wa familiarity and chemistry with the unit last year that allowed exceed the sum part when you take that away the part don necessarily add strong playoff team paper ,0
visited friend they have many student there they were squeezing like dude into small as room ,0

have never said brogdon better more valuable than blessoe and really don care just glad brogdon pacer but something that the stats don really show brogdon will most the year going into his season and ha been improving every year bledsoe will most the year and going into his season and his counting stats have actually dropped off bit with very clear prime from around also think usuage play big role don have stats back but the game watched seemed like bledsoe had the ball his hand more often which will lead more assist well turn over also wa really ever brogdon bledsoe thought the buck signed brogdon meant heavy tax middleton don get why everyone stuck this ,0
,0

just because gulen also bad doe not act defense for the bad shit ergodan doe where the fuck did defend erdogan yall have idea what whataboutism mean and favorite people who just don want admit that the choice that they defend also shitty one there are three people and two them are shit and they dislike each other should support one just because nonsense read the definition whataboutism discredit opponent position charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving their argument agree with kanter that erdogan bad but guess what also don support his choice either you think that whataboutism guess you just want reality where only have binary choice and thinking outside those two choice shouldn allowed american have already adopted that model you should instill canada the duerte trump hitler comparison also not apt and honestly idiotic duerte trump wa facing hitler election that would make sense comparison since they are all involved the same event but btw who would you pick hitler pol pot and kim jung were all running the same election you got pick one and you can say anything bad about them since that whataboutism ,0
you jumping off your right leg righty basically start his stepback but into jumpshot after the first foot go back instead both perhaps using throw off defender timing because they jump the stepback and that let him draw easy foul ,0

wa not much better jaren scored more per possession lower efficiency but spaced the floor unlike ayton rebounding least important skill you have and probably the easiest improve also affected factor like ayton playing center next guy and right under the basket when jaren played next marc and jaren also wa and grew almost inch and added some muscle that should help with rebounding and foul trouble which are his only major flaw taking footer who can shoot three and switch smaller defender while also being great shot blocker ayton better mid range jumper post ups and rebounding which are the least important skill today nba ,0
show the salami ,0
light contest and his slow release mean probably ha drive because mechanically his shot isn optimal ,0

death tax and tillman literally being willing die before paying any kind tax couldnt think better spokesman for buffoonery like this ,0
what redd legacy hall very good feel like good modern comp for him khris middleton arena wasn that much more impactful but least could take game over and win you few based offensive talent alone ,0
cause they force fed that shit ,0
think that their goal represent the league tokyo right now opposed visiting area with which prc ha historically had strained relation make political statement against prc political spin that doesn appear working well enough ,0

been rocket fan for like week and already despise this fucking owner ,0
shit high school right now get scholarship hope can hoop college can imagine not hooping what truly love and one the thing love the most ,0
further from home nba player are primarily american and team are america there much more connection american policy issue but you already see how foreign born talent like kanter stir controversy because their political opinion the difference with kanter the nba can support him because erdogan crazy dictator trying kill him and turkey relatively small market with china though with quarter the world population you playing dangerous game trying criticize their government with the censorship law they have even with what should pretty cut and dry topic like the hong kong protest ,0
they got make the playoff the east ,0
stand for which translates your mother dead basically fuck you ,0
morey latest tweet getting ratio hard chinese fan http twitter com dmorey status anyone know what nmsl mean ,0

small hand normal wingspan not being freak athlete dunking out the realm for like guy ,0
grew california never watched sport but family you were either lakers clipper fan honestly wa just because didnt like the color yellow and purple that decided side with the clip more often wasnt until that really got into basketball had been living san antonio about yr then spur were heading the championship final the whole city wa party centeral and had really taken liking kawhi leonard and his character and off the court everyone hated him for leaving the spur but bandwagoned him the rap and now get follow him again back the childhood team would root for before taking actual liking the sport thats how became clipper fan more than anything tho fan the claw ,0
tacko fall probably going struggle score inside even not getting hacked ,0
yeah right know thread about role player here but let not rewrite history here ,0
wasn seen top stop trying revise history ,0
lb not sure why never been able jump high ,0
cant tell drunk sarcastic but buzzed with friendly ,0
haha wow ,0
yeah but they are great player can tolerate them doing well fvv solid player but seems always play exceptional when bet root against the raptor and shit the bed when bet either him the rap ,0
that true the lakers really have flexibility without giving role player ,0
these video are fascinating keep the great work ,0
about wingspan web shooter ,0
this sub just randomly turn this into joel versus ben yikes ,0
lol idk you trolling what not but not today little brother ,0
miss explosive blake miss how use shit pau lmao ,0
excited watch play with discarded future ,0
spitting real fact here for better malsada half the wait time pipeline bakeshop kaimuki where ,0
need bring his arm straight still going across the left side his body make more difficult get shot game especially ,0
that wa straight drive and low key still kind fumbled bit before his last dribble didn think the dribbling wa very impressive like the confidence and aggressiveness though edit look like kind flat handed the ball http imgur com thmrd excuse why there many picture idk what happened ,0
everybody supposed have player height from their draft combine memorized ,0
wait how you clean your as ,0
you loved him much you booed him the biggest night his life always good generalise the whole fan base from the idiot who attended the draft night with the sole purpose grabbing second fame ,0
because set standard and doesn vary ,0
don hate him because don like using that word for people who aren scumbags but strongly dislike mejri for known reason ,0
mutumbo probably wa shorter than that when the pic wa taken people age and become shorter ,0
funny cuz look like midget but irl still athlete who could probably kick most people ass ,0
evan fournier ,0
you are right but wa both end they game planned towards harden switching onto lebron wade they continuously torched him and his confidence plummeted until wa even useless the offenesive end then they took advantage that and basically gave him open look the rest series never seen player shook that bad life ,0
kobe bryant the most skilled player the history the league wa wouldn the best player the history the league but isn not even top ten ,0
nike stay disappointing ,0
think the dude trying make joke about kawhi kauai ,0
athlete are always getting better think pretty short sighted think even possible see someone top our lifetime ,0
stream ,0
did you forget the clipper existed before lob city they didn even pretend good ,0
from utah not ,0
live california don like the lakers fan base and like all the player the team ,0
piston are the piston and kyrie irving had absolute shit series against the buck ,0
looking forward see all these guy chuck mid range shot now ,0
for that def read different way curious what your take andre miller comp for foot shorter jokic though ,0
nah just hate his face ,0
wouldn shorter much considering only and wa wearing dress shoe the photo saw say the difference wa negligible ,0
bad the perimeter solid inside ,0
now that stretching for sure ,0
they trying their best ,0
dude doesn realize he florida now and nobody there wash anything ,0
difference that finish his shot better than lonzo shot ha much higher release and more fluid follow through small difference but big enough where they vastly different you can see lonzo shot still noticeably segmented ,0
second world country and only reason not first world because the corruption you wrong that one player don have choice they have established team you either gotta play you don play all not like people were coming staying vancouver the owner committed and the culture the team there and something you can embrace that what lot player will invest ,0
wa one the better shot blocker the league best straight when wa most recently healthy almost one allowed lower the rim and racked block too ,0
kwame brown wa traded for pau gasol derozan doesn make any sense for the lakers much worse defender than danny green and would make our spacing way worse kuzma better shooter and part our long term future along with hopefully kuzma game also better geared toward playing third fiddle opposed demar livid watching him take mid ranger jumper foot within the line when have two the best most versatile scorer the world the floor with him ,0
wa exactly that for the last couple season excluding season wa miserable watching but wanted stick with this show till the end thankfully with the recent season the show much better and invested what happening and enjoying ,0
worth ,0
can bet anything both you stand close each other probably make you look small most nba athlete are just freak not just about height standing reach wingspan frame play big part then you add the ridiculous athleticism and wrap ,0
booker might the player with the most opinion them compared the least amount viewer never understood the overrated stuff ,0
like how people argue with about what heard people say like you have different experience and have different friend and people around you but from experience large amount people were saying wa top all time also had guy argue with about how kobe the goat over when kobe retired there that edit just looked through your comment history kobe your head bro mamba mentality kobe definitely not the top ten all time probably barely top around that all time mark wa wouldn the best player the history the league but isn not even top ten response bunch player going train with kobe looking forward see all these guy chuck mid range shot now ,0
the mariner haven made the playoff since ,0
wendell carter ,0
probably lose little weight ,0
not much the morning anyway except know sleep since ,0
,0
only lakers fan would try argue that ,0
course doesn anybody with brain know how stupid look the playoff when your point guard hiding near the basket and your center the perimeter after simmons disappears yet again the playoff barely touching the rock the quarter will full blown feud ,0
true and how dare you ,0
make your own post one day with those story ,0
celtic fan damn why didn think that ,0
brought here way more often than person see people talking about relatively normally here ,0
from the university texas the thin agrarian ,0
haven laughed comment this hard while ,0
haha look like good time could you imagine the bull had the free taco for point scored today their fan would eating well ,0
got back ,0
start sucking friend dick haha this funny joke man ,0
still think would great have you guard the inbound passer crunch time especially baseline close the bucket ,0
for the last playoff gsw hou wa pretty much the west final lmao ,0
okc because wa his prime ,0
there percent chance never step pro basketball court again what are the odds return percent let alone ,0
drake didn even get out his seat ,0
thanks you can sub youtube for more ,0
that wa just nba final lol ,0
actually never dribbled even one time ,0
wa definitely not offered the max horford declined the from the celtic like week before free agency the sixer were always the mystery team literally heard nothing about jimmy miami until after that jimmy possibly leaving wasn the only reason they got tobias but wa definitely hedge might little far with but sure brett and ben liked tobias way more than jimmy and they were never bringing them both back ,0
dont like jeremy lamb because keep roasting dont know why becomes prime curry whenever play ,0
you started following the nba the last year why would you care about the lakers past ,0
step one take off the warrior lakers jersey step two buy clipper jersey step three talk about how you been clipper fan for long time and read about michael olowokandi and all the other failure from their franchise past ,0
don see the correlation ,0
there actually analytics reason why player who shoot significantly above are very rare from basic math perspective the point per possession one your shot better than the team average the team should trying get you more shot the league leading milwaukee buck had offensive rating which translates point per possession disregarding foul and turnover this suggests that you shoot better than from matter what team you play your team should trying find you more point attempt result player who shoot above those number are generally either catch and shoot specialist which case might hard for the team generate more attempt since put burden the playmaker player who played before the analytics movement developed this understanding steph curry who shoot well above this mark even when creating his own shot high volume the focal point elite offense ,0
clever ,0
harden averaged with steal game the playoff for the rocket what are you about mate what part that historically bad ,0
gronk nick foles and some other arizona football player reportedly won couple pickup game the arizona basketball team nick foles http www espn com blog philadelphia eagle post eagle quarterback nick foles also division caliber basketball player apparently stud and gronk just impossibly strong ,0
knox not even close our best player are you kidding had extremely rough rookie season and still very young morris also just way better than knox wa productive starter while knox wa statistically one the worst player getting minute the entire nba ,0
ene kanter never back his trash talk game ,0
like mitchell wa meant but something malfunctioned ,0
they changed the rule ncaa basketball because bill russell wa too dominant defensively ,0
not really lot player that the problem see that he still kind clunky you can see two distinct segment his shot the best shooter all that blend from the load the release could shoot bit higher too ,0
heh heh ,0
delete this nephew nike probably ,0
will but still isn comparable ,0
yes footer are not meant blitz pick and roll protect the rim and then sprint foot contest shooter ,0
that why these sixer fan keep clowning jimmy because they know they need him ,0
they need make the game fair isn the bench losing ,0
slightly confused considering shaq only ha mvp lebron doubt should have multiple unanimousimous trophy however ,0
just waiting for the next evolution with jordan killer instinct curry shot and lebron athleticism odds are the kid get drafter the ,0
see this what talking about first all you have clue did this before not second all you have clue anybody else ha done before either but can inform you that kobe used you are just objectively wrong that claim third all you have clue miami going keep doing this not either thats point you have clue all and neither you and are the couch potato and they are the proffesional athlete are not position question these guy workout routine ,0
can play the wing necessary but not his strongest spot ,0
probably cooked snake ,0
angelo russell because the moral absolutist teenager nba who don understand nuance can separate two different issue cheating your partner and exposing your friend bad faith and take out him ,0
nba marketing man they are phenomenal ,0
man wish wa the nba right now easy money ,0
watch any these guy warm ups yea being tall help but don think they are the most talented player that make are wrong watched pau gasol warm person this dude hit three pointer row rarely take them game action any human any height cant shoot like that ,0
statement stand ,0
well ,0
ha some serious hop only ,0
that smart they don fit together very well all and rondo can contribute more against the opposing bench ,0
melo wa significantly better than demar ever wa will ,0
lonzo form looking lot better this translates over game watch out nola not playing around ,0
the wolf haven done much outside ,0
again average height nba player height percentile for usa male don you think that prof overvalues height mean height important doesn mean more important than skill nba player are both tall and skilled sure the ratio foot men the male population bigger than the ratio footer who play some sort competitive basketball people good the worst nba player meaning any competitive advantage being tall give you can overcome very achievable way ,0
well bored let that round round round round round game against season game against season round and definitely earned him reputation like that the rest those game not much ,0
wasn speaking the release wa only speaking the fact that lonzo brings the ball similar that part irrelevant what were talking about ,0
what made you think wa upset just made sarcastic joke didn realize anybody wa gonna take personal bad ,0
zion roy then the pel are gonna running out lethal starting jrue reddick ingram zion favor that just tough defensively they are balanced offensively ,0
wait other people not ,0
what obnoxious mine obnoxious ,0
probably had that way because the short end when come sg ,0
right going his final year but your second part incorrect it guaranteed pro rated roughly per year for year then the not guaranteed youre referring outside that ,0
really thought saw zion with hulk fist getting measured the combine ,0
why not try shaving your asscrack ain that hard ,0
you guy got small foot ,0
then the next supermax after curry ,0
know and agree just fucking with that dude injury happen every year ,0
wa his height never jump ,0
agree with lillard obviously ha little bit talent the mic but overrated because play basketball shaq wa better artist than him and not even joking still listen some shaqs joint occasionally ,0
get ppg this year then happy ,0
isn jimmy butler with wingspan pretty crazy that natural while clarke more that just go show how big difference solid handle make ,0
think the nugget might problem ,0
zion would get ducked height not advantage for the position ,0
except there bunch evidence that prof that statement wrong literally there comment this thread with evidence ,0
what doe this have anything with this thread ,0
nah kobe objectively ,0
apple pie time ,0
not for dunking his wingspan hand size play huge role helping him finish ,0
centimeter ,0
you know how when player get fined and end being like regular joe guy dollar wonder what eating one donut for them like eating apple considering their workout and how many calorie they burn each day ,0
mary jane ,0
don say didn warn you ,0
need lock the door since have shower knife handy ,0
draymond versatile defensive floor general all star and one not the most skilled runner the modern nba unfair have such skilled power play runner team with steph and with one the highest player gravity the game watch video him almost always make the correct decision ,0
hope they play least few minute dying for some bball ,0
wish curry switch and just skyfucks with his goat offball movement ,0
have idea what height with shoe ,0
except literally ha ,0
boomer state mind ,0
and took him shot get those forgot about that ,0
ray allen too lol ,0
want rewatch the best game his career the jump calm down ,0
appears two young star just can get along ,0
standing reach the most important thing for dunking what are you talking about dude ,0
skilled and best are two different thing shaq wa better than kobe because his physical superiority against other bigs made him extremely effective and efficient scorer but obviously kobe more skilled because can more thing the court but there discussing nuance with the typical nba scummy nephew who doesnt even watch basketball have picked ball their life with love boner for lebron and the immature and pointless need shit every other great player the history the league prop their idol ,0
literally the top mind the nba ,0
mean people already talk about guy being legit footer this isn too different ,0
two year older ,0
even john wall say would probably run yard dash outside receiver such tyreek hill tyler lockett john ross only using their straight line speed forgetting agility and stop and route would smoke giannis coverage don get wrong nba player are fast hell and would make look like obese whale tried keep with them but nfl athlete are specialized what they that wouldn even close both sport have the absolute best the best athlete the world just athletic different area you put fullback for example against giannis and giannis wa asked wrap and tackle there extremely good chance giannis getting trucked that same fullback isn going shit try score him basketball asked try guard giannis ,0
yeah cause coach and trainer actually now what best for them and what type routine they should have also what you are referring here player who sit all night playing video game not going early get extra workout the fact that even have explain that difference you laughable you have clue about jimmy sleep habit and thinking that you are position criticize him for just because you seen coach and proffesional trainer pathetic assume that jimmy sleeping habit fine until hear otherwise from someone that actually know what they are talking about ,0
weird want edit ,0
remember draymond saying they expect treat them like they done something when they haven achieved nothing and that hit different ,0
yeah never let anything touch butthole because homosexual ,0
top nah take lebron kareem shaq magic bird duncan wilt russell and hakeem over kobe kobe like ,0
explain why wa constantly trade rumour then wa even pitched the main trade piece execute trade with when wa with nop didn seen any you complaining about that ,0
forgot kristaps even the league ,0
rebellious kid who annoying family are lakers fan ,0
fisher may very well nice guy but thought his departure from the maverick wa unprofessional and dishonest ,0
casual fan alert lmao ,0
joki genuinely don know why just ,0
shaq that ,0
noooooope ,0
hey now ,0
about develop such mean slouch that itll make quasimodo jealous ,0

wish could get number how many new fan blake brought the team guess lot ,0
the reason and other great shooter that relieve tension their shoulder during their shot ,0

ingrained into australian culture that included the australian citizenship test booklet and our national radio broadcaster ha bradman batting average it postcode ,0
idk why but that seems sweet innocent lmfao ,0
get your game ,0
what the fuck how did not know this team existed one point ,0
nba player make full sized donut look like donut hole ,0
chuck ha huge frame orangutan arm and huge hand wa also ridiculous athlete with tree trunk for leg chuck wa never disadvantage except when had guard crafty and tall forward like mchale the post chuck stood next dwayne johnson who around and made him look tiny not just that wa taller than him but had much more bigger and broader frame ,0
noooooo not this guy ,0
sorry but lonzo ball one the most likeable player the league you dislike him because his father you are fool ,0
damn can read lmao nba rookie strating creep well ,0
which chuckle fuck responsible for that should have been pacific the latest ,0
kawhi that kid kindergarten that share the donut his mom packed for his bday ,0
who this guy just strategically releasing shit never get read him ,0
what know mike and scottie had control over roster pretty famously low pull for being such winner the bull did trade mike year and that includes some during his hiatus lebrons team have trade since july next ,0
lol big ball that reporter dude definitely reddit that you ,0
lebron prime wa these are the year wa all nba and all defense player and put career high shooting percentage and the best advanced stats his career apple apple comparison might comparing them the same age for example age kobe shot from lebron that age shot small difference but that all there when comparing great player ,0
hit three game though ,0
who know the rivalry may start again since the clipper reloaded with some nice piece ,0
you reach teach ,0
relief tension your shoulder that why done ,0
thats final mvp ,0
literally living fossil dad might say living dinosaur ,0
mean it been reported http bleacherreport com article jimmy butler rumor star declined er max contract before heat trade that turned down but the kinda thing never know for sure and outside being maybe the worst team ever keeping our draft choice secret it not like the sixer telegraph their move why would have heard about jimmy the heat this the first ever heard someone saying that jimmy had anything with trading for tobias maybe the reason and missing something very possible but never heard that before think the horford move happened once they knew about jimmy and because that wa left out think jimmy wa great and the trade wa the right move but even the sixer had won think move ,0
were fingering as lol ,0
all this excitement about his jumper but haven seen single one where wasn fading away don really expect much tbh ,0
can look the roster without getting pissed the rating and how off kilter many them are idk ,0
shoe really add lot height ,0
the fire rise ,0
ersan ilyasova ,0
like when vegetable joined the gang and became good guy edit vegeta leave cause it funny ,0

digicamo ,0
what the conflict interest sham isn opiner espn just report transaction ,0
what statement why would the team anyone having anything with the team admit that anything wrong what posted ha evidence joel getting heated ben even admitted probably not anything huge but not nothing while the subject any idea why and butler left worse situation ,0
unless smith wa one the four then don really know what happened ,0
the celt have been final time year yeah one final appearance damn fine thing ,0
combined ,0
like said said before still gladly take the chance returning resemblance himself god forbid chance than take role player and gobert bother the other people that also said ,0
wack response ,0
but sure every other fan besides laker fan are okay with romana sucking clipper dick lol ,0
officially favorite player all time now just for this what fucking stud ,0
but you have strategically fold some your dick doesn touch the toilet rim when you press against ,0
both are true ,0
zaza pachulia liked this ,0
honest being eastern conference all star isnt that impressive when guy like dragic and dlo are making just not the kind attitude want see from him maybe not pointer but the dude need develop some semblance jumpshot ,0
only also started playing cornerback and started getting ton interception ,0
they should get cigar and blowjob too you are just handing out whatever ,0
why you guy have genuinly curious ,0
this only raise more question did kawhi order from there because just because the name connection and handing them out like middle schooler who ha birthday wa kawhi pretending actually own the bakery some very mild form prank how did jerry west end with one ,0
and aaron fox ,0
said they were too not many people want their parent sibling walking the bathroom them while showering ,0

didnt watch the game dont know but you are outrebounded youre prolly gonna lose yea maybe you need try something else that being said sound like finished the game with her and the other starter the bench which wild you cant that like the first game today acuna didnt run because thought hit homer and only got single what shoulda been double during the regular season his manager pulled him from the game for that exact thing but realized this playoff game and our best player let not that ,0
are all atgs this blessed day ,0
raymond fucking felton but it totally provoked ,0
usually side with the medium this stuff but wtf they want they asking him about training camp scrimmage his teammate themselves have been talking about him taking shot they keep asking him the same question every day gotta annoying fuck just wait until the season start and still isn shooting fair game but that wa dumb worded and baity question the reporter ,0
maybe maybe because didnt enough defeat ben simmons for roty smh ,0
same man like really cant believe there are gm this young fuck dude ,0
rondo without lebron will far more successful the only issue that lebron happens play lot can see why caruso wouldn able play more alongside lebron ,0
one dare play him out respect get easy basket all day ,0
the reporter asked him have you ever made practice impressed wa able laugh that like what stupid fucking question ,0
clip weren ever worth much knicks are though ,0
luke just going play rondo straight minute ,0

for sure terrible question the reporter idk why needed add that all star tho just say like you right haven but you see this year something like that ,0
blake griffin wa pretty cool and from liked both team when wa middle early high school even got pau gasol jersey but had more fun watching blake even they lost and eventually stuck with the clip ,0
mind the fictional basketball player would have average something like pt asts with handful rebound steal and block game guard for year through the and and win few ring along the way revered basketball the great one hockey there are few any people ever who have single handily dominated sport and had their record remain unassailable like gretzky ,0
probably play league legend with gordon hayward ,0
you said that gaining weight just hard losing ,0
touche ,0
lol loo ,0
it gonna wild for sure one spot pretty much open for sure with okc going down but also pretty likely lakers will take that spot other than that everyone pretty much stayed the same got better only spot feel for grab are the spur but just tough truly ever count them out ,0

doe anyone actually care that much seen these thread already but cant for the life understand why anyone would care much about their true height ,0
kawhi hand are extremely big ,0
can start with being fan player did you like brent barry with his dunk the dunk contest started watching him more closely then realized you watched more clipper game than you care admit started getting attached darius mile and richardson saw livingston actually break his leg wa disbelief when they traded for brand draft night lived through the kandi man lamar odom wa the next magic pooh richardson clipper loy vaught after all that that when you realize you bleed purple and gold you know those player mentioned above will respect you clipper fan those are true fan ,0
hate him because play for rival team but you guy can really that mad guy who signed with you over his hometown team lebron and result got you shit ton free asset you wouldn have otherwise ,0
these fucking title ,0
just pointing out how that dude said both are true ben denied never hitting averaged sophomore should have been rookie all star too but the nba doesn like doing that ,0

dont think there good answer that question honestly like such stupid question and then followed but you havent made one game that hasn been put him different way time really wasn even question sounded more like the reporter wa just shitting him get soundbite ,0
http youtu bfhs ubjs ,0
not that great basketball player anything but right handed and left eye dominant and always brought the ball the right side face think just one those extreme outlier who someone trying just get good shooting shouldn even bother trying emulate lonzo should focus getting his jumper close textbook possible the good news his form definitely look better than used making progress ,0
omg why this this sub anyway the only reason this issue because people are too soft and will complain and nobody watch anyway there you summed the complaint for you ,0
look like kind flat handed the ball http imgur com thmrd rather than really had control the dribble ,0
mean kobe the iso god all time not even for debate ,0
harder make the postseason baseball but yeah they have been awful for awhile then the sonics got taken away least they have decent football and soccer team ,0
ain curry ,0
everything about this ridiculous lol ,0
rondo play his full potential when literally let run everything when the court same bron this brainer though not bad idea run them both the sometimes because they can play together and play well just you get more out rondo you let him run the show when out there ,0
that explains why lebron ha gotten many all star ,0
what you mean ,0
doesn have give stale contrived answer acknowledge his weakness and tell what done improve obviously generic sample answer wa stale and contrived ,0
honestly hope ben shuts the hater this season and just start shooting them ,0
okc just cause grizzly played thunder lot and wa important part okc ,0
your flair ha made three and isn good ben anything else seems weird for you find this funny considering one your favorite similar but worse situation ,0
this amazing miss the bull ,0

this video ha dying bro kawhi just quietly unpacking fucking box donut from his own bakery sharing with trez and then random shot jerry west eating one the donut lol ,0

and shoe and can dunk either fat too bmi that doesn help can pretend dunk though since can touch the rim with both hand ,0

eric gordon potato head lookin as too ,0
not tho ,0
watch your mouth ,0
most his season career high are with the thunder also feel like wa associated more the okc core rus harden than the raptor which ha changed considerably since arrived ,0
taking shit the toilet right now and fucking dying laughter over here ,0
mean the opposite ha also been reported and just think about jimmy did all did minnesota get year max and turn down good team just because wade told him the plan never seemed like wa keep both jimmy and tobias from the court financial stand point also jimmy the heat wa planned out that far the heat wouldn have scrambled the way they did when wa time trade for him trading first round pick and harkless not mention the failed mavs trade while the sixer everything with smooth and quick like they been planned out ,0
reporter asked dumbass question ben gave him shitty response don mind ,0
dejounte murray isn good ben simmons defense rebounding interesting oddly okay with that because ben simmons wa the number one overall pick and dejounte wa don know why you mad wa just explaining what took place the clip lol ,0

he the type guy who love baiting opponent talking all this shit then the moment they react just throw his hand look the ref innocently and like what did know what he doing just doesnt like owning and pretending he above ,0
when lived year ago see the heat play every game could clipper ticket were half the price then just started going rando game because tix were cheap they ended being fun gritty all star expectation team watch way more talent than expected ton heart they reminded the heat way but were able put all together better these last two year the heat have always been but that how became clipper fan ,0

think you are putting word mouth not claiming about fall off cliff all just simply saying that asking someone the primary defender kawhi while being the main offensive engine huge load maybe can handle maybe the lakers need look pick wing defender share that load that all saying dude ,0
actually didn know that why people always say that ,0
not gonna bother reading any that crap except this line stuck out you probably still think it impossible predict short term price movement equity you mean like modelling sde and other type gbm and more that fractional brownian motion yea how about you come talk when you actually know what mcmc until then keep reading those and keep talking about that cpa yours trying explain that quant fund don give shit about finance lol bitch why the fuck you think laughed your cpa the bottom tier toilet paper would wash as with cfa significantly harder than cpa and while still isn that useful least tell you better than number janitor there doubt cfa significantly harder and more prestigious than cpa that undeniable even amongst your useless anecdote the idiot people you work with ,0
danny ainge would trade his own mom for the right pick ,0

bogi could win both really ha mip season off the king bench ,0
sham ha already proven shill for thing that could benefit lebron with his reporting the fact that the grizzly wouldn buy out iguodala ,0
your goddamn right are ,0
now this believe this ,0
course they respect his outside shooting but the guy point you were originally arguing with wa more that team want him shoot rather than drive the pick your poison term they choose let him kill them with jumper not actively prevent him from shooting them that what happened this situation lebron previously made deep late the shot clock and wa going launch again they doubled him what happened wa scored and they were down and wanted mix thing they ended forcing tough fadeaway from kuzma and were able get out transition wasn about him specifically hitting deep wa more strategically timed double ,0
awesome hear that ,0
one championship about year not but yeah thats exactly why ,0
lol wtf ,0
there minimum account age post here think getting filtered out ,0
imagine alternate universe where every article about the knicks came true ,0
wa really hoping for him too sad news however having arthroscopic procedure done doe not necessarily mean catastrophic injury there still hope there for him wish him the best ,0
did understand you sarcasm and disagree with the underlying idea behind said sarcasm hence reply did you just literally define exploitation which isn subjective word with meaning like all word then say you disagree with the definition which you were kind enough give please find the correct word phrasing for whatever you thinking because exploitation taken thanks for ending that argument for feel that you believe that the value added society doctor isn properly represented how they accommodated for the skill they have that add that value correct and that they add arguably the most say teacher but that some chicken and the egg shit with one keeping the other alive learn from him how keep him alive which why you feel they exploited the most not scale you are either exploited under capitalism exploiting others that the economic system that how run this where good evil come since the whole thread started over the idea that there are good billionaire idk why you try dismiss the topic the conversation you are exploiting others pay your bill can not and will not able think you good but won think you even slightly evil unless you prove otherwise honestly most people just are know like genuinely good people and like genuinely evil irl but show such lack awareness the world around you and the struggle the exploited worker from every sector face every day you don look the mirror with disgust putting money your wallet off the hard work other people once every person earth basic need are met can start having good billionaire until then fuck them all ,0

yeah sure just coincidence that guy who used genuinely known fan for his smile and joy even some his later stop like houston stopped smiling only after getting memed for year about seriously personal aspect his character that likely isn true the first place ,0
about time became serious about the game since left orlando ha entered multiple market expecting treated like wa orlando earned that love there through hard play and result and the city loved him for then bailed and thought could anything and loved alienated superstar and bench player alike not mention coach and front office glad see him get serious and hopefully will payoff and can see him happy again once prof that his love the game strong once wa only then will earn the love the fan and his team and that should make him smile ,0

nugs lol ,0
maybe even unhappy seems uncharacteristically serious being the jovial big man did not win him damn thing over year the nba perhaps time try change his approach basketball you get the sense watching these interview that just isnt the cheery spirit used when wa orlando his cheery spirit did not win him damn thing supposed skip and down the court with wide smile all the time him saying had kill his ego get where now top the fact that always say doesnt have many friend the nba why doe need friend the nba they weren bound together being the nba you honestly believe would friend with other player howard ha like five bastard kid should busy being father them not looking for friend out night and possibly knock some more woman which mean le money for the bastard already have that he trying play other people rule and it ruining the game basketball for him ha bad can retire play china where can dominate other player with smile his face ,0

that mostly because they just didn care the regular season and they were not concerned about the clipper all that first playoff series when golden state wanted lock you down defense they did losing iguodala and klay for most the season going mess everything they defense this year they can switch everything anymore they don have death lineup going struggle don know what klay going look like when come back this season can exactly just assume going great like usual klay close normal though think can decent defensively just don think this roster can dominant then offensively going struggle put the ball the basket when curry off the floor theoretically dlo help that give them primary ball handler and playmaker when steph sits they never had that before however dlo and piece isn going get you great offense betting you see lot steph playing with bench unit this year because apparently you can slot curry into any lineup and have top offense that way give dlo more threat the floor and balance thing out ,0

serious say accomplished nothing beyond disrespectful yeah didn perform the highest level but done far more than most hoopers have ,0
and late first think fair criticism that the dunc guy can fetishize draft pick little but that first golden state owes memphis not guaranteed late top protected when steph will top protected unprotected maybe the warrior will the new spur and just keep rolling but there downside ,0

lot subjective imagination here but imo kobe the better shooter going make this argument lot but wa raised this era think his shooting would lot better didn make focus until his achilles tore relied the midrange his whole career basis for this would his excellent massive volume argument the beginning lebron better around the rim because bigger subjective but believe kobe ha more creative finish and better with his footwork finish how would ever tell who more skilled guess kobe but see why many lebron the most debatable one imo lebron better passing but not that much more than kobe again kobe grew this league think would much better think where most argue lebron excels making the read and the cross court pass but wa that kind play prevalent when kobe wa young imo the early wa characterized clogged lane shooting and iso basketball all that mean kobe never adopted any this into his playstyle and sure enough retained his scorer mentality but saw many flash cerebral read and game adjustment again sum give lebron the slight nod passing but every other category like kobe better ,0
first really didn like playing for him relationship had grow ,0
this need protected thought someone who wa pissed wilt deleted all his highlight and that wa why much wa missing ,0

everyone gangsta until this man literally say nice the post comment ,0
absolutely wasn last year take his contract potential but you have seriously overrating him underrating middleton believe that not that wa saying middleton contract better than both them anyway wa just naming the other two guy who got similar contract totally get the argument for murray though isn currently better than middleton and the nugget giving him that extension year early far more baffling move than the er buck maxing harris middleton ,0
same dude brother and woke early hell watch his draft combine cause were loyal shit thought lebron might sign with the brown for season boy can dream ,0

think there difference between the them and think somewhere around game improve each step think kemba win you more than dlo and dlo win you more than rozier think losing lamb and not having replacement for him hurt more think losing parker despite limitation last year hurt some even think losing kaminsky despite having more limitation hurt this team that will rely rozier bridge monk and batum and maybe zeller can last for more than half season doesn look good also think some the competition around and under them last year got better miami look like playoff team now orlando rolling back and they look lock for lower seed the net look like solid mid seed instead mid season maybe detroit look about the same for good worse atlanta chicago and even the knicks all look better than they did last year and least one those team could push for bottom seed see every reason believe that the hornet will from ,0

gotta giant box pre rolled joint only logical answer ,0
imagine letting this dude drop you for his career smh nba player should embarrassed ,0
worked and refined over the off season even got respectable defender like danny green with just using this occasionally order enter into the defender calculus have them thinking about one more thing where have counter not gathering and continuing into drive shown pick game time and time again that ha use not something that will pervasive the stepback obviously but gotten down where shooting off one foot like dirk but just different iteration reducing the variability his shooting movement one foot need sync rather than two which some argue result straighter shot don think will popular for other player take like the eurostep stepback and side step shot because difficult coordination but harden always working something the third shot something doe working having pocketless shot shot pocket that donovan mitchell raved about when talking abotu basically you don have just single pocket that you can shoot from then that make you even more unpredictable and able get shot off without performing all sort contingent set into shot rhythm ,0
the last thing should doing shooting learn play defense and get offensive board instead ,0
think there difference between the them and think somewhere around game improve each step sorry but don live the same reality you think not having washed tony parker cost them game just have agree disagree ,0
look lot better pulling for him ,0
mean might able save some gas the tank tho and not fatigued will see ,0
comparing that tape silly basic turnaround off often basic setting that look great when shown repeatedly highlight tape yes super defendable post move anybody close being size relevant not hating wilt btw had needed develop more nuanced game compete the modern age willing bet would have ,0
maybe lighten bit ,0
but this isnt math problem you don subtract from both side ,0
not rooting against player who love basketball more than anything that great for them guess just jealous that love nothing much they and find weird that someone can love game that much ,0

kinda agree and kinda don help humble rookie also make them hungry for respect and make them want prove themselves long doesn overboard the same time though dropped out pledging frat because the hazing they did wa dumb shit basically work yourself until you throw then keep going feel like can good motivation funny tradition that build team chemistry beyond just vet and rookie but can also taken way far like when the buck filled that one guy car with popcorn which wa hilarious but also complete dick move ,0
think you taking this the wrong way market value objective value meaning that shaq saying that objectively better than dame even dame pretty good ,0
you can say dickhead the internet okay ,0
obviously amazing but think gerald green catching off straight lob instead off the backboard make just bit better ,0

mix that with poor mechanic from the time and you not doing something like fading and shooting the downward your shot wilt doe the highlight shown you going shoot too strong and shoot long most the time actually did try shooting free throw fadeaways also tried bank shot from off cemter and underhanded which wa among his best but not good gladwell think and from couple foot back wonder had just tried one style and tied get that fine but there wa mental thing considering shot better from the line high school than college and college than the pro ,0

according bball ref kemba wa worth about win which actually relatively big for the sake this argument though pessimistic and say add about win terry the other hand probably about see the hornet win team next season which won the worst think you are underrating the hornet role player would take their defense over the cavs defense any day which wa historically bad last year can meme about terry contract which well deserved get made fun but still take him over sexton start the season ,0

the step back creates space temporarily but once land still ha straight and give the defender time close for brief instance you are shooting while fading sideways than harden will point going only and down while the defender still moving towards him ,0
wow shaq went ,0
one the most lopsided game basketball history despite preseason game and this prof that the houston rocket team for real ,0
there isn any team the west that could have their best player miss and besides maybe the clipper rocket fucked portland fucked utah fucked denver fucked fucked gsw fucked that already the best team the spur would probably relatively but they are aiming for low spot either way ,0

and harden didn mesh well all wa reduced spot shooter time that not what make great all his stats dropped playing with harden feel like you confusing didn mesh well with not using player his full potential harden and meshed pretty well the offense operated very high level when both were the floor together and when just one wa the floor time just because stats were lower relative his career average ha nothing with his fit next harden ha with the fact wa playing different role ,0
they got some real chemistry ernie the straight shaq and chuck duo and then kenny way kinda like the glue guy indirectly just being another person gang any them ,0

cant wait see harden and rus rub off eachother ,0
you right maybe his next brilliant basketball invention that one ever thought will shooting from half court ,0
that clearly play designed for imo going deadly the defender cannot help off harden because rus will kick out harden the wing spot along the point line there the defender guarding the man the corner close rus kick out the corner not every time ,0
the knicks deserved that though they didn even make extension offer after all the other shit they already put him through from the first moment wa drafted ,0

warrior sixer ,0
that actually common and curious misconception not sure where coming from tbh westbrook from last year wa the highest his entire career and way higher than his career average his next best effort from that range wa the data can found his basketball reference page just after advanced under shooting ball reference doesn have data for for but really the range they provide the best range for finishing the rim ,0
with last name broadus wa just asking called brodie instead ,0
actually the new law will cut out the ncaa and school could directly player and cut deal for their likeness and image ncaa and school are not upset because they care about student athlete the are counting all the money they are going lose student will able collective bargain their percentage jersey and other sale ,0
same use more possession sure like that point game against raptor where wa much more ball but dlo isn exactly lightweight usage player curry will play way that belief will contribute win ,0
are you intentionally being dense this how shit operates the day day what better risking kp health and missing multiple game maybe even season resting him and missing game and being able play there only right answer ,0

you still get fed the off season and the summer you stay campus which most since they are enrolled summer class reduce class load during their season all scholarship athlete major program have access full meal plan lot power school have specific cafeteria just for their athlete where they serve better more nutritous food ,0

ledamn right ,0
the west stacked team that list are all capable beating each other any given night ,0
agreed good change pace play catch the defense off guard when they expecting another iso ,0

generation succ ,0
imagine lining your formation fucking and seeing that guy across the plain fuck that shit ,0
sixer rocket town ,0
steph and draymond have ring together and aren mentioned ,0
ene kanter ,0
pissed were the spur bertans wa from last season ,0
just say weren watching basketball when duncan wa his prime winning ring and leave much simpler ,0
think this useful move for harden specifically the right corner right wing three reason team will always force him right from that vantage point and essentially concede this shot fadeaway drifting right unblockable with defender his left hip doesn need much range this shot would the top the key since the foot corner three russell running the show top and harden can shoot this shot clip higher that pretty big deal because mean that can conserve ton energy just standing the right corner for some possession while russell run the show obviously would have his typical role when rus out the game gassed ,0
rocket sixer ,0
agreed this season would much more interesting ,0
lakers sixer ,0
year able tell grandkids how people used shoot jumper off two foot ,0
contagious someone quarantine horford before play orlando and unfucks fultz shot ,0
fabio riff raff ,0
not sure intended ,0
this ,0
yeah tend agree although should make for interesting move use for buzzer beater you basically guaranteed have that look available ,0
zion never missed the playoff well ,0
honestly not sure like joel he the better defender but can perimeter centric time which could pull joel out the paint then again putting him dwight waste his ability you probably right ,0
one ever going make college free while people still willingly take out figure loan masse attend ,0
favorite android ,0
some guy can some and shit but can lose guy because they just doing move rather than actually timing their cross guy lateral movement lebron wa showing off some kyrie dribble move couple year ago and that wa the difference kyrie did his behind the back dribble part getting somewhere the defender wasn lebron wa doing them place learned the move but wasn second nature yet ,0
that hard believe just cause would mean his percentage normal would like which doesn seem plausible ,0
exactly this the only correct answer this stupid question ,0
look like lady rage http www youtube com watch vzapt ,0
only trevor ariza and bynum were never injured final weren for the bynum injury the gasol trade might never have happened ,0

what ha that gotten him what exactly ha lillard achieved his career compared rus lillard shoot the playoff rus shoot there literally zero argument that lillard better all time player ,0
feel you but they still would have snaked you guy their nature you guy warned ,0
ready hurt again ,0
tim duncan wa god san antonio leonard wa just knight ,0
because even their best they clearly tier below the western conference elite team they never been true threat golden state houston since aldridge left lillard great player but isn the truly elite category james durant curry leonard and harden there limit how good your team can when you only have one elite player who isn the top five they made the wcf but got the easy side the bracket golden state houston would have destroyed them even full strength nurkic really good but isn the difference between four game loss and series win ,0
don think honest hard imagine the spur mantaining that level sustained success without dunacan wa fundamental not only player but also leader the called spur culture wouldn exist without him ,0
specifically talking about player coming back play close home and getting booed especially nba said maybe because the net actually have some franchise history unlike the clipper ,0
lmao old texting about boy and tellimg her miss you much fucking creepy anyone with half brain can realize that stop defending the dude because make music you like some old knew wa texting old sister cousin whoever those thing youd think wa beyond fucked like any normal human would ,0

listen kid you can literally take anyone court for anything never said would win his case just said should sued missing call different from known official going the record and saying they were purposefully missing call would obviously attempt take the individual referee court and the nbra would probably hire the lawyer for the referee honestly though nigga get sued everyday could happened them ,0
look you little shit ,0
this look real asf lol ,0
where the world did you get the official nba stats and going back his cumulative percentage foot range ,0
also think they were beefing the time ,0

the only guy who have been fluid and skilled enough legitimately play point guard and are also pushing foot are ben simmons and magic consider them both complete athletic freak ,0

everyone should agree that the heat were his first superteam you have have some kind neurological impairment think otherwise can agree there his next stop for his second stint with the cavs wa also superteam kyrie wa already two time all star and made the all nba team his first season with lebron what did term all nba and all star selection while playing with lebron significant the argument than what did prior kevin love wa time all star and time all nba player before joining the cavs not mention consensus top power forward the league people forget his record double double streak being the first player have game long etc that guy wa legitimate star the league add top player all time and that damn well superteam two the four year those three played together all three made the all star team the same year again you have have some kind mental deficiency think that doesn constitute superteam you don need have two top five player have superteam the loose definition usually more along the line having three all star caliber player the same team big three for the lakers well they have two top player that certainly superteam ,0

one know what mean but provocative ,0
they seed kinda ,0
you can argue that kawhi better currently but doesnt really have argument over harden alltime still say harden better because kawhi had better team than harden plus the warrior team faced wa nothing compared the warrior team harden faced harden also put better performance against the warrior this year than kawhi ,0
blake griffin tobias harris john wall ,0
shaq wa not long ago embiid exists both have personality very similar wilt ,0

dodger are got enough ucla people bring down usc football ,0
nah this year those are actually some the most expensive game whether clipper lakers are home traditionally wa just slightly cheaper for clipper home game but nothing significant ,0
what can the clipper offer raptor definitely won doing that franchise any favour lol don see how that deal get done ,0
like the cheap clipper tix ,0
and blake were both booed dodger game wa booed mma fight yesterday see the similarity ,0
found http mobile twitter com johnschuhmann status not bad remember but it still terrible lol also it just shot the last minute idk what his gamewinner ,0

yes didn know wa player too ,0
grizz leg well grizzly ,0
wa already doing that beforehand ,0
yes the had empty the full clip game for demar ,0
gotcha thanks for the info ,0
piece shit deserves kawhi the kwitter ,0
talking about who better player all time the playoff lillard ha gotten the wcf well the second round multiple time himself westbrook himself hasn done shit look his last three season first round exit every single time ,0
obviously subjective but imagine most player with that amount fame and wealth would choose living over toronto ,0
and actually waited until the appropriate time talk team ,0
joe johnson ,0
kyrie wa draft barnes wa and wa year they the same age and high school class ,0
during usa basketball when you have literal team all star glorified allstar game not like they are going run play and play and look both them are going the team barring anything heinous they are both skilled player their own aspect you have your opinion have mine and doesn seem like either are gonna back down lol ,0
think you meant say accompanied the warrior their straight final appearance ,0
lol what laker fan know ha converted especially witt coming this year well ,0
jameis seems like care though eats for crepe sake ,0
ridiculous statement because there way better ball handler than the guy like steph and kyrie who have been doing tested and proven ball handing drill since they could walk your definition greatest only encompasses most innovative then yeah could the greatest the citizen kane problem far the most innovative and influential movie all time however it and own and without the context what wa grand scheme thing barely stand stuff shot nowadays term entertainment value and story telling although still great movie it own ,0
but maaa ringz earnaee ,0
lol the booker kat thing mean nothing just left after year ,0
well shit only people who want see lebron and play big preseason minute are the nephew over the medium circus and nba laker fan want watch their star play when the game actually start mattering ,0
redemption year incoming ,0
ringz erneh ,0
talk lot for doing nothing the post season ,0
think denver much bigger threat rocket could amazing could total mess ,0
nbgay ,0
say other than the top kareem jordan lebron steph can win another title the main guy could end anywhere from through and might still yet even without don think what shaq hakeem duncan chamberlain magic larry bird have accomplished outside what steph might able accomplish ,0
off brand vince carter ,0
chandler parson can relate ,0
accurate throw ,0
spur that shot the dark for sure but can count pap put ,0
sadly ,0
ha year with player option left those two guy could have taken restricted asked for sign and trade they wanted out ,0
boom another stat used people like you trying too hard swing the pendulum the other way raptor were againsts team over every other win wa against lower level squad apart from blowing the warrior out some other good team forgetting kawhi raptor staff chose game wouldn needed ,0
dam that crazy ,0
why not both ,0
kyrie shooting with his left ,0
hotdog stand around the corner lol ,0
nba contract are just like that top role player get max near max deal because the money the nba astronomical and there aren that many guy you have pay his deal manageable because the king star player are rookie deal they have flexibility when they have pay fox and bagley also premium position and the king had glaring hole there last season hence why they traded for him solid option that can hit create late shot clock scenario when necessary move the ball well also solid versatile defender that can switch multiple position wa let down dallas but just not number scoring option dallas had pay someone though and struck out every big free agent that season kept bad dallas team from being the worst team the league and still got their guy luka with him being the tank captain ,0
every single mvp that been hof eligible ha made there nothing prove doesn ,0
you should appreciative gave you guy the only championship your team might ever have for feel you wish ,0
get point just put across mine value defence much more than offence opinion biased the all time argument lean towards harden solely bcz his regular season accomplishment and his offensive output kawhi never going have the number point not comparing their performance agst each other saying harden beat the warrior with the regular season but couldn beat the warrior without the playoff knock harden just wished had stood like lbj doe again and again and took the rocket the final then would have actual kawhi harden debate ,0
sure but scale matter there are just way more kid going through that now ,0
you losing streak ,0
each position ha different background basketball analyst have college computer science degree statistic and come from target school some start coach before moving the front office scout usually start scout for college team and transfer over eventually and usually come from one the former mentioned background player agent ,0
athlete celebs are whole different thing though get why kawhi would choose leave homie acting like shit toronto every way possible which far from the truth might overreacting but people don know how don want believe how sick toronto ,0
the one clipper fan know this exactly lakers ram duck angel but fuck baseball honestly ,0
that exactly point which why unfair discredit spo for having him spo maximized lebron took him his absolute peak built team around insane efficiency and the best defense and revolutionized the nba popularizing small ball and inverted offense spo top people who put stevens there are joke ,0
remember seeing documentary about this http www youtube com watch qxmoyoc zzw ,0
anthony davis when realized how horrible the lakers are ,0
kawhi will find out that the raptor were actually exceptional their load management plan and that wont get that kind treatment pair that with the booing will get every home game and the fact that the team wont autowin game without both him and george the court and would demand trade back toronto ,0
say pretty much died down here montreal since calvillo left the team suck and the stadium always empty seriously nobody give shit about the alouettes ,0
daggered hardens rocket harden ha significantly improved since then and had consistently played higher level than dame for year this point disrespect dame because dame great but don really see your point not the level that harden and ha been for few year now just feel like you are being disingenuous ,0
put this way offered you million buck find someone with clipper jersey within day you would lose ,0
that the team that all the retired eagle fan see ,0
you kind are well you think they lose the first round ,0
mean not true hofer the sense that only got because there weren many people playing back honestly the dude would probably struggle make roster the modern nba ,0
king hockey ,0
kobe great athlete but top you right top ,0
kobe wa much more athletic than demar lol ,0
and you don think fan were arguing about what else are skip and stephen reacting plus you had jerry west oscar robertson and scottie pippen all put lebron the debate with the latter two straight saying lebron better than jordan ,0
curry defense shit rough out there ,0
you just want watch all star game hate all star game because there defense and player don try that the problem ,0
they will split start allen get outmuscled very easily guy like embiid drummond and deandre will help those matchup ,0
refereeing hand sign cheering taunting posing trash talking whining and the occasional pretending want get into fight ,0
even grandma didnt give that much candy ,0
lot player also enjoy fuel them knowing they have hater like that some player manage play better those condition and may even hype the hate train they can perceive envy oppose hate nonetheless these type professional usually through some kind training class when come crowd and hate booing the end the day think come down how emotionally responsive you are how logically responsive you are would reckon that kawhi more the logical responsive side shouldn really have affect him ,0
this ridiculous much that find hard believe you live people that live know better ,0
macho tough guy ,0
some men just want watch themselves burn ,0
lol sacramento but think they will either first round exit conference final exit all depending klay and bench ,0
anyone that watched know talent wise top all time doubt unfortunate didn win more ,0
you not wrong about palmdale but you very very wrong about county not even the top geographically and the largest the state socal alone you have riverside san bernadino and kern county which are significantly larger than county the largest population though ,0
what are you upset about just that lebron getting praise from former player ,0
agree but not like wilt mile ahead shaq shaq threw people around like ragdolls out there ,0
see about that ,0
but wouldn biased laker fan ,0
watched and kobe their prime take ,0
are not large house but are proud one and every man from barclays fight with the strength msgers ,0
personally think the sport management kinda some way doubt single any major sport football basketball hockey baseball actually majored sport management ,0
lord you twisting word during the olympics and the player start experimenting with move they wouldn use nba game not saying would turn into full blown game but the will decimate every team player will not try like they would nba game ,0
clown here really acting like kawhi didn put that entire team his back for two straight round because fred vanvleet showed curry and siakam had great remember this entire place wanted lowry head siakam wa overrated and marc gasol wa old until they finally got helping kawhi panic meltdown just calm cool solid energy the main difference from when demar wa still around ,0
then you not looking ,0
every player would rather championship than mvp award ,0
and you know they doing some other hard working athlete right now yeah for sure think the minute piece wa mentioned that the ref some them least were bitter about how much more money the player made than them sounded like the ref acted like some cop with their own code and vendetta feeling like they personified correct basketball and whatever they did wa virtue coming from them the right call also lot them were betting game according the guy ,0
people sleeping the warrior lol all forget that after the final before they signed they were betting favorite now obviously the team ha much shittier bench then but god damn they got they gonna good ,0
will see sac def playoff this time ,0
the preseason that can win with these cat jerry ,0
that the stupidest thing ever heard the reason every single mvp the hof because every mvp ha had long and accomplished basketball career ,0
well that true then you still got small dick mentality tryna injure people pickup hoop you can contest dunk without taking someone out intentionally then you little bitch who doesn belong the post indeed smallman ,0
looking forward seeing how the cavs manage all these asset they need clean house all these guard get love contender garland need that ball ,0
this sound lot like isiah thomas though wa all star for basically his whole career never came close winning mvp peaked place voting which received place vote fmvp for his championship but wa the best player the team only all nba year his accolade are decent ,0
not scrub bitch ,0
could see that think come down performance and who season ,0
the answer clearly nicolas batum balled out portland the option iirc got paid charlotte and proceeded fall off bit every season ,0
here fuck kawhi ,0
minute without traffic typically ,0
only way lose the first round lebron go down even go down still have hopefully well rested lebron and and player this time around ,0
believe the blazer lot but they ain wcf favorite ,0
and rob pelinka keep talking about thrust ,0
lot networking and kissing as just thinking about that make cringe hard ,0
shark ,0
wouldn get any award but get hell lot clout ,0
that true heard grew but went riverside something well why not move the team the inland empire that sound better than san diego possibly ,0
inside play the game wa tied all they needed wa any form point played lillard too close risk opening vast more amount move lillard ha his arsenal such blow for lay step back from much closer range than footer unless you saying lillard shoot better the further away from the basket than close just from shot probability stand point just make sense risk playing for something that much more higher chance making which the majority original point ,0
our overrated anyways beginning look forward rebuild lie ,0
still find hilarious that there would any difference price for game between the same two team the same city thanks for the reply ,0
but the heat were already done then for while ,0
klay huge and think over ,0
right now maybe but during the pete carroll year ruled ,0
,0
long time lakers developmental coach ,0
whaaaaat you mean they aren all rich movie star living hollywood what next you gonna tell there are poor people there lol nice try ,0
basically all based stats have clipper early sun bledsoe all time great perimeter defender for some reason ,0
yes you are right guessing there are some physical freak that would always exception the rule ,0
shaq would dominate wilt though ,0
king won make all ,0
see you bobby portis ,0
you look term their salary cap consumption for their team their respective sport good comparison kirk cousin make million and the nfl salary cap million that the viking salary cap eric bledsoe make million this year and going and the nba salary cap currently million that about the buck salary cap ,0
bit long winded given the context ,0
love klove but unless love our city then think both party best interest part way are not going contender for long while and kevin can still contribute third forth option contending team ,0
shanghi ,0
nah that ben simmons ,0
need kawhi villain mode like lebron did ,0
wa good georgia tech ,0
exactly what thought ,0
yeah people always lul salty laker fan but you look how calculated this dude wa behind the scene completely fucked over two different fan base hard possible boo him too ,0
can unless those sort pic are photoshopped which have always suspected look his hairline game the final after his headband fell off http imagesvc timeincapp com image url http fcdn com public fsi fdam fassets lebron james nba final game miami heat spur single image cut jpgw http www gannett cdn com medium usatoday usatoday final lebron jpg width height fit crop ,0
what random fact that ha literally connection with anything discussed all lmfao swing and miss ,0
feel like know get fucked steph and doesnt wanna admit ,0
hideously bad team those year last year they sort broke out partway through the season ,0
heard when the afroman walked through the white land all the house went for sale tho ,0
cmon bruh not synonymous with champion winner like people are scared let the team they hated for year and now can wait call them underrated steph are quite literally the worst backcourt basketball defensively klay iggy hide either them draymond can start the season out shape this year the king got rid wcs for reason not only their bench shittier the worst the league okay say the warrior aren winning the title ,0
lowry siakam fvv powell gasol will fire yes ,0
decimate every team huh watch against spain against serbia ,0
what that python javascript master race ,0
easy spot the nephew who just started watching basketball they have clue about pacer playoff who looked like superstar against the lebron heat while just being above average the regular season ,0
people are saying harrison barnes but did anyone believe wa the missing piece dallas when signed with them his contract now with the king about the same his contract with dallas and they resigned him knowing wa the scoring option wiggins the other hand wa super maxed with the thought his progression would have him top player and then regressed and plateaued his development ,0
what the fuck ,0
kat because minnesota ha done pretty shit job building around him ,0
forever laker nation ,0
until rose ,0
draymond grrreeenn ,0
seriously overrated ,0
throw king somewhere between ,0
yeah bad that what meant trade him contender portland ,0
lmao how old are you man ,0
yes decimate every team want you name country that can compete with that starting lineup top having loaded bench ,0
been following kobe since took brandy prom his career alone ha made him favorite player all time but his post career stuff really seal the deal from the creative venture coaching girl basketball this dude really tryna live his best life and contribute whatever what see fit pretty cool witness ,0
where tony parker that shock ,0
klay will back before the playoff ,0
jayson tatum like yes leveling the playing field ,0
sampson olajuwon ,0
would booed him regardless lol fuck the clipper this will always lakers town ,0
every time his team hit rough patch http medium tenor com image bfaa tenor gif ,0
you straight guy nothing gay about fan wanting blow pro athlete especially one with as like lowry ,0
very talented guy but why the hall ,0
very respected development coach wa cleveland and developed kyrie and stayed there until lebron left joined the raptor last year and now ha assistant coaching position the lakers ,0
people didn target simply for being minority they targeted him for the thug culture represented thug culture code for black culture white people can pretend cowboy outlaw all day johnny cash and white country singer can sing about running from the law killing man reno etc all day long and nobody get their panty bunch join militia and point gun cop and get away with they have their own thug culture and dress code and they don get penalized for this way wa the first remember bringing certain black aesthetic the game with his tat corn row and jewelry and the nba head weren very happy about this and think they were pretty vocal about too from what remember this year they banning the tie headband nike somebody probably called them and told them they are going lose money people start just tearing some clothe and tying around their head ,0
lol understood what you said just wanted add ,0
glad will back take his happy as home round one ,0
all tried the gym ,0
probably pretty dominant against the warrior tough warrior don have big guy that could take advantage unless looney win most improved player rocket well who the rocket have beat that besides the lakers don see team that can take advantage the west ,0
holy shit forgot about them you honestly don hear anything about them they aren winning would slide them and push the raider ,0
lakers sixer and few more team absolutely have argument ,0
unpopular opinion this thread but that whynot zero color way ,0
don think theyre winning shit but they big threat though agree that dlo and steph gonna drop night and give ,0
kinda funny that just decided spurn all the love got from that city play for the clipper and get boo every event go lakers fan ,0
few buck most and probably due the difference season ticket price that people value and sell ,0
first per team mean ,0
laimbeer rodman ,0
then why didn they decimate spain with kobe lebron and chris paul why did they struggle against serbia ,0
compare iguodala and kawhi fucking leonard yeah agree that sound really really stupid ,0
paul george ha been traded the alaskan bull worm ,0
the same time this guy are driven denier and hater some them grew with the odds stack against them and use motivation achieve greater thing can see this being good motivator prove this entire stadium wrong and plus after the first season them playing awesome basketball everyone will get the bandwagon until the wheel fall off ,0
even with kahwi gone possible the raptor got better collectively ,0
did you forget played for team before toronto ,0
imagine calling other people delusional when fact prove you the delusional one ,0
kobe saw wade the invite training camp get good and decided get ,0
wa the chosen one wa suppose bring balance the western conference not destroy ,0
why they were banned nike probably want make sure kid are buying their dollar headband whatever they cost and not just tearing off part old curtain tie around their head ,0
and asked for trade the summer before ,0
doesn did wouldn see legacy player kobe curry horford etc take many spot the nba upper echelon excluding few freak like wilt and shaq beyond certain athletic baseline your success almost entirely your training and whether not you get access resource scout pick you for aau program the myth scale pernicious ,0
fox alone probably make the king more promising seems like the next one term pgs the future add hield bagley and bogdon and you have starting lineup built for the modern nba even barnes still ha good amount room improve vuc probably the best player either team but good amount older than any the young promising player the magic have making the window not match all that well ha high potential tho probably not the same bagley bamba question mark but believe good too just may take while fultz can either way really isaac could either break out nowhere got unique skill for his size and length just decent offensive player with versatile defensive game poor man tayshaun all all give king ,0
team usa select team ,0
los angeles ,0
don know about schedule for team besides lakers but hawk are kinda low and pelican might bit lower ,0
kawhi randomly retired after hof for you really don see that argument ,0
phew nice recovery dude nailed ,0
yeah and because award heavily skewed politics and voter fatigue that doesn actually get awarded the best player the regular season example lebron ha year dominance harden wa historically great last year but they didn want give him back back because they wanted more european fan and fresh face also the only goal nba season win championship the only regular season award should high playoff seed ,0
didn want downtown san diego and they wouldn approve then moved second fiddle the ram they probably would have got the stadium built they were actually contending for anything ,0
yeah and the first matchup against struggled get while they mocked him one point for stat chasing ,0
olive garden ,0
yes and considering anzchutz owns majority the lakers and king anyway kind moot point the abyss family only owns enough percentage claim ownership and run the team operation ,0
all the more reason you shouldn able force trade you sign for million dollar that contract being paid for the fan coming watch the game you screw those fan over when you get traded another team ,0
lol siakam hasn made one all star had one all nba all defensive selection and already year old highly doubt make the hof gasol ha only had all star selection all nba selection all defensive selection and dpoy award year old and highly doubt will make the hof either ,0
and the worst ,0
chino hill ball bro style lamelo doe manage top and actually given the reign his own offense and lonzo running they could the two fastest paced team the league they have success could the next wave playstyle lol and lavar will the visionary behind all and everyone gonna fucking hate that ,0
are the salt mine the bay area the reason all can only afford cardboard box apartment down there ,0
and how much care they put into their body with their diet workout routine and stretching yoga practice read kobe would take about min day just warming his toe finger foot and hand before got into big muscle group ,0
andrew wiggins and the long pull brick ,0
size they both pretty average height weight for their position not really saying much here shooting larry member the club sharpshooter club luka shot below league average both ft and something bird ha never done what way that similar playmaking larry wa such good playmaker facilitator his first season that turned the losing record celtic deep playoff contender his rookie season luka good playmaker especially for rookie but larry wa elite his very first season lack athleticism larry ha above average athleticism especially for his team people always assume larry not athletic because they compared him magic but had very good rim finishing ability because agility along with his wa definitely above average luka isn good handle but not flashy the one thing can agree sure people need chill with the comparison because luka nowhere near rookie larry bird skillset ability unless you count being white skillset ,0
kobe got hurt pretty often and took year off his career especially the end just played through ,0
okay not multiple tier really don see the issue here feel like most people here don actually comprehend just how large the gap can safely ignore playmaking because harden definitely different league compared term court control compare just scoring harden averaged ppg elite averaged ppg very good harden isn only scoring more point than doing better efficiency too now someone go from scoring point per game point per game would say that player went from good role player potential offensive star depending age course however going from ppg ppg something already see often the other hand going from also point but significantly harder fatigue set and defensive pressure step that point that gap literally the difference between the best scorer the league versus great scorer the league multiple tier absolutely not overstatement harden had arguably the best scoring season ever the modern day nba surpassing any kobe scoring season and rivaling best scoring season ,0
this guy jam ,0
atm looking for anyone who would willing get rid fptp and actually through with ,0
really brainer kobe wa the cockiest asshole the court for year because wa just that fucking good just like bird ,0
jermai grant underrated ,0
lebron crab dribble ,0
your main unit minus leonard and green ,0
demar derozen overrated question otto porter underrated for sure ,0

and what proof you have that this the truth and not just conspiracy that sound right discredit melo ,0
the team can refuse make the trade ,0
how did not get concussion from that fall ,0
overrated brogdon love the guy but people take his season and assume one the best shooter the league good but one the reason his high because never really took any contested three his playmaking decent but ha tunnel vision and doesn have the dribbling skill the main playmaker the floor his defense the playoff wasn solid wa previous season but wa coming off injury willing give him the benefit the doubt still good shooter and really great driving and finishing but people kind inflate his skill just because played okay and made timely shot the raptor still high him though and can still improve the pacer underrated ben simmons honestly yes doesn have jumper but people really discredit how good despite his limited offensive game great finisher and always threat driving the rim not mention his insane passing ability versatile enough defense guard well just doesn have the perfect team around him showcase his skill because best with shooter around him spread the floor and that might make people see him worse than ,0
played year division basketball before body started breaking down after having not even touched ball about year can even imagine how sore would played game now ,0
year college player who shot his final year georgia tech his shooting wa too much liability for him ever become the two way all star calibre player people were projecting probably wind better without the acl tear but wa likely never going great ,0
their odds winning are high just due the fact that their only potential roadblock the final only one team which philly their matchup advantage the fact that they can big and use their size overwhelm team and emphasizing rebound buck have hill korver connaughton ilyasova and robin lopez off the bench compared neto korkmaz ennis scott and koq which questionable middleton ha shown clutch time but you right that would need prove bit more and tobias doesn seem well under pressure there reason been traded despite team saying they like him ,0
you can ride the accomplishment your past superstar conversation about this season ,0
alex caruso epic dunk compilation http www youtube com watch sup ,0
hate the idea you want speed the game then get rid medium timeouts shorten half time and start the game time looking you espn don fuck with the origin the game though ,0
dude dwyane wade made last year reserve kobe made too when wa his his last season those guy made based the legacy they left behind but one could possibly argue that either player deserved all star their last season that why using all star game judge player isn always fair imo all nba much better accolade use for judgment ,0
you know what you jogged memory and remember that well that kyrie wa under the impression they were going build around him not bron poor guy get lot hate for decision that wouldn really that weird other industry doe say some monumentally stupid thing sometimes though haha ,0
yeah man good coach doesn anything what kind offensive system are you supposed design around high usage guard who can shoot the first place having one the best play maker all time next one the best scorer all time sure they work something out ,0

good lord only nba would have people arguing that player are like slave because they can demand trade these people are among the most richly compensated human being ever exist history and they aren compelled shit they don want play the nba they don have they can work regular job for regular salary like everyone else the world they want play the nba they have live with the circumstance which mean that order for the nba have some semblance competition and parity which frankly there isn much the league allow team have contract that can enforced and allow team some kind stability every other job company the world ha set operating procedure that employee have agree order work there but somehow the athlete that are oppressed for having the same thing the only year old mentality the one where you are star struck your favorite athlete that you convince yourself that they are being oppressed anti progressive with slave like mentality because they believe they should required carry out the detail the contract they signed exchange for hundred million dollar honestly this sub ha been infested with fake woke ding dong and much worse for ,0
thought they were only teammate twice for some reason ,0
cassidy hubbarth such milf ngl ,0
didn play the nba but the tallest basketball player international play wa even taller than this suleiman ali nashnush who apparently played for libya the according his very short and sketchily sourced wikipedia article wa actually closer your exact number the time played professionally all that said there footage nashnush playing basketball and can find photo either though could have sworn saw one kid and libya doesn appear have qualified for any major tournament the year supposed have played for their national team the year the fiba championship although there wa least national team that point not sure how much basketball actually played alexander sizonenko http wikipedia org wiki alexander sizonenko who played high level the soviet union and their national team the wa also listed during his career and much easier verify ,0
underrated kelly olynyk for sub that get off efficiency extremely efficient stretch that defends well and making million should salary dumped apparently overrated zach lavine seen him mentioned bunch time the same breath devin booker and don see score efficiently though understand why liked ,0
wait you were year old ,0
deron williams wa dog his prime ,0
player duncan caliber doesn concern himself with player tier two below him suppose could have unfortunately garnett had bad habit not making past the first round the playoff ,0

how wa that accidental ,0
when did you ever make about this season regardless have the identical and staff with improved team from last year reread the title this post ,0
ish smith and half the league ,0
brogdon good one basketball fan are weird idolize completely arbitrary statistic like for example someone like curry vastly more efficient than brogdon despite not really reaching field goal percentage because take many more three that lower his overall but his overall much higher what brook lopez did last year wa more impressive than brogdon give and half pointer game shooting over pointer game math say lopez more valuable shooter and yea ben simmons really underrated weird spot where not really star but also overqualified role player and ha one the more peculiar playstyles don really like his fit with embiid although what else philly going think you put him next team kind similar how the rocket are constructed but with more transition play think absolutely brilliant ,0
the last few season say otherwise they played well together few year ago but both have been the top dog and league mvp the meantime would seriously surprised either too willing second option ego powerful motivator ,0
sign and they have space for more than that because they are one those team that go into the tax when they for all jimmy wa signed with bird right they can two max contract dragic isn being signed and they attract them like they always have lol miami get big name every decade the aren going different ,0
watch the video ,0
which isn really all that relevant the point being made ,0

and redick can dribble wouldn say didn like the pick roll they used even tho they are pretty much the same thing ,0
,0
celtic fan but jaylen brown way over rated ,0
both sentence ,0
the reductionist logic make sense this case the caveat are already laid out there championship alone are meaningless but individual success combined with championship make perfect sense for comparison feel like nba always this dick riding championship comparison don make sense all know which championship matter and which one make sense compare for player similarly context matter and you and the rest nba like ignore favor counting number and efficiency stats and advanced metric that clearly can corrected for but ultimately culminate actual achievement like the case olympic runner have people gotten that much faster the single generation that much better nutrition been shown that the vast majority improvement from the earliest olympic event result environmental change better shoe le wind tighter and more aerodynamic clothing better ground etc same thing for basketball not going bother responding the overplayed shaq bit one care how much kobe memorabilia you claim have the internet not racist best friend are black more valid basketball than anywhere else not even kobe harden thing allen iverson dwayne wade the extent you consider tmac ray allen reggie miller manu ginobili you don think any these guy made conscious decision have shot chart that look like wa drawn with compass wouldn able produce with that level efficiency much le having team that doe the same ,0
the only reason jordan won space jam wa because movie magic they rigged for view ,0
god thought you wrote jerian grant and almost had seizure jerami reeeeeal good ,0
irvine ,0
not about just talent about the schedule ,0
sure bro have you know wa first team all state every year high school jersey wa retired even ,0
nah that would bandwagoners ,0
mean yeah but smoove one the most exciting player ever for partially because the fact that you never knew which version him you get all needed wa locked his role defender and mid range post player and wa all star level not better evidenced the one season seemed like actually did care feel like lot people watched his stint with the piston and rocket and just thought wa over confident bum but wa damn good time ,0
kind erratic shooter though ,0
kobe wa too scared because along with every other star wa too afraid their private airplane wa going get highjacked some arab dude the luggage compartment lmao that and the alleged rape wa still there refusing wash away like ejaculate stain ,0

people are downvoting you but you right every call the video you posted clearly travel ,0
somebody should have given him lesson over eating dude look terrible these day surprised life see ,0
here quote from article just saw every time athlete would something crazy would get trouble for father did very great job using scare tactic obviously understands what wa being done show lot love too first check blew neal said friday cnbc fast money blew like minute but neal wasn just being careless with his money bought mom car dad car paid off their credit bought them house explains http www cnbc com money lesson shaquille shaq oneal learned from his army dad html ,0
porzingis coming off injury and the west insanely stacked not too high dallas and think this season will adjustment period trying assimilate porzingis into the offense think successful season would having the seed just few game out the playoff they make the playoff that massive success eye ,0
new move like his step back simply traveling and not called the nba like would have year ago not called because the nba definition traveling not that most the time stop being ignorant the game isn the same wa year ago either change get left behind ,0
reflex well parkour martial art lot sport you learn how fall without hurting yourself least minimizing the damage when you repeat something thousand time becomes reflex ,0
there language contract player exercise way operate outside that contract good for them team the same like the nba organization because the player have way push back against the team ,0
actually got decent midrange and touch around the hoop but always end convincing myself that god and then will from ,0
think slightly above the pelican like fraction that can surprise few team few night but mostly think can catch team who would slipping san antonio pel maybe portland ,0
mean horford played better than anybody our team that series ,0

bron lumped can you tell about game against those big celtic ,0
lebron doe lot shit better than other player cause athletic freak too haha didn tbh ,0
maybe but dame and mitchell didn perform like the best player that series that the crazy thing about the series lot time when better team loses because their best player didn play like the best player that series giannis and middleton performed like the two best player and they still lost ,0
agree with the pacer comment ,0
the west just too deep for say that not making the playoff would mean the mavs season wa not success long they are least the race for low seed the very end the season and luka and look like they are developing chemistry the court then would call that meeting expectation even though that would still disappointing them and their fan base ,0
wa injured last year decent enough defender ,0
every time the lead more than the trailing team hoop start rotating ,0
yeah this team make the playoff they will definitely exceed expectation most people have them finishing just outside the playoff the west just too stacked ,0
only ,0
kelly olynyk defends well huh ,0
did return the favour during kobe rape scandal ,0
edit that exactly how remember the play going down ,0
lol wouldnt expect warrior fan make that reference ,0
you score while the basket upside down they remove point from your score ,0
yeah olynyk solid big man very underrated can stretch the defense pas the ball decently isn negative defender ,0
bump hard defense and won call foul myself unless blind person could seen wa foul ,0
and the lakers were high him too but were win now mode waiting player develop ,0
obviously the former lol but given how the rest your comment played out not surprised hope not get another notification from you ,0
salty the heat for taking james butler from this good move for them ,0
fvv ,0
kelly olynyk just meh fuck his dirty play though zach lavine agree don see him getting much better even though wa super high him still fun dunker ,0
moral out the window when the team thing explicitly allowed voluntarily signed contract really sum the reflexive love famous celebrity and want new stuff phone all the time mindset that chunk this sub into they really don team found contract loophole that allowed them only have fine they refused pay player contract sure the attitude here would markedly different viewing this like some sort justice issue par with blue collar labor comical and the comparison fall apart completely least some case player and their agent are doing thing detrimental the team teammate and fanbases that are explicitly prohibited and saying well the team should have written slicing the tongue out the player they really wanted them follow the rule not even vaguely convincing ,0
yeah those certain first ballot hall famers are all really underrated ,0
yeah earl the goat not into believing that one given his height bill russel say could kick the net and touch the top the backboard wilt said could too would have been interesting see someone like michael wilson try could dunk hoop ,0
james harden would out week and dye his eye red ,0
bird played year ago course the point difference substantial ,0
mike conley almost overrated this point with how much praise get ,0
that seems very reasonable but last year luka showed the ability thing throughout the regular season that were mvp like they get any game they are close the they have shot win glad they sort have this season tempered expectation though just think luka are quietly saying each other that they can whatever the other super duo are doing and maybe more ,0
spoelstra good enough coach but need tim duncan his own reach pop level ,0
the only coach lebron couldn fire ,0
his prime wa good duncan get that duncan the better player but let not act like as compared duncan ,0
smart they keep missing purpose they can run the play over and over without stopping ,0
height don mean shit when parent want whoop their as friend and his dad the funniest thing hve ever seen wa see his dad jump slap the shit out him ,0
james jones ,0
really just like mike http streamable com ,0
compared other player just not durable lebron opinion lebron groin injury wa pretty much his first injury and bron take day off ensure his health which kobe didn even though should have kobe also played longer than but still had more year playing more game wa the biggest freak all time imo ,0
did but don get how that would effective all shaq can control what the other player ,0
just saying that comparing thing like block rebound and assist disingenuous considering the fact that they play two completely different role ,0
yeah but kawhi leonard different stratosphere than westbrook defender ,0
you got that right ,0
yolked that pic ,0
ridiculous talent like his had miss the playoff year row his prime ,0
there wa play against army where literally had like block one possession wa one the craziest thing ever seen like get absolutely fatigue from jumping the dude dicked our nation army right front eye checked the highlight wa actually only but had more absurd block the next like minute ,0
give this bait real solid work here ,0
dikembe wa dominating defensive player love kemp and but not going get mad anyone who argues dikembe wa just good ,0
shaq grew during the cocaine era nba history that lot beating ,0
that literally the exact opposite risk the money literally guaranteed the player negotiated this because they wanted the guarantee not the year year risk pro player you want but least make sense ,0
successful season would getting through the season healthy and looking like did year ago then they could start actually building around them the coming year ,0
that the guy might have only been twice though ,0
because the only people publicly commenting trade are either analyst who don know anything about young prospect unemployed coach gm and million ignorant fan marc gasol obviously turned out great piece the opinion everyone else were wrong and the grizzly were correct happens quite frequently same thing wa said about okc now oladipo star and sabonis very solid young piece ,0
shaq dropstep elbow dude out the way thunderdunk ,0
dikembe kemp ,0
the opposite that ,0
finish top the conference and everyone stay healthy ,0
weird ,0
the funniest thing hve ever seen wa see his dad jump slap the shit out him haha poor kid ,0
heeeeeeyyyy billy bitch tit ,0
the shake and bake probably one the smoothest looking move all time ,0
stupid comparison aside that highlight video wa awesome ,0
multiple player have tanked their trade value and ruined season for their team both being public against their contract and being injured when they wanted and healthy when they wanted player have not only done the former ,0
the team that scouted him and traded their best player for him clearly did expect him good ,0
not mistaken smith and iman shumpert feel like those guy were always being packaged together trade ,0
also dragged simmons into the crowd pulling him down and could actually injured him know probably just wanted hug but that wa bit too far ,0
lol the irony this statement that you proving your own point later the comment thread sabonis put way better offensive number and the much better offensive player more point assist offensive rebound and much higher efficiency seems that you too are overrating brown and underrating sabonis due the team they play ,0
will hilarious when dunk your favorite player wait your favorite player caruso that doesn make sense ,0
see what you saying dikembe and can equal defense but offense not close kemp buries him ,0
horford better than middleton and you could argue with how well shot the ball that series combined with his defense series for series wa probably better too ,0
brian scalabrine man look super fucking white like look like the whitest fucking history the red hair the shitty hair cut and face shape ,0
yeah but the step father former army fairly sure had wa still solid muscle and had the muscle memory give whooping ,0
lol really ha become his signature ,0
one cry and the other fucking berates official it black and white ,0
think help ton but they win dude like honestly the most important player that roster term what brings the table ,0
for sure wa good athlete and could definitely get the rim but his passing and handle weren anything special today game wa more classic shooting guard archetype not combo guard ,0
you won the dumbest post the thread award congrats like godwin law but for this sub thread go long enough someone will make horrifying and embarrassing slavery reference and that point you lose the argument but you did win the awared cited congrats again ,0
ben simmons actually underrated imo elite defender passer rebounder and great athlete tantalizing because decent shot away from being one the most complete player history and perennial mvp player reminder just and still year away from his prime ,0
yeah white bald dude that look like dad randomly dunking nba game pretty hilarious ,0
that wa all real you conspiracy nut bet you believe the earth flat too ,0
your face ,0
keep gettin dem check avery ,0
you are coming into this only the owner making the rule those fine aren loophole those are the very clearly laid out guideline which they are operating both party agreed those guideline let hold both side accordance those justice argument here you just looking for reason find agenda you want argue against throw that little bit there for which kinda telling yourself there reason those fine were the agreed upon rule and not some ridiculous thing like that false equivalency you throwing out there about cutting tongue ,0
perfect modern day small ball center jealous the nugget added him their roster for just pick ,0
two all star and two all nba isn that amazing put the best stats for one their championship but wa certainly never the best player any those spur team wa basically always second best not trying argue that iggy better nba player anyone that actually think that crazy but there are quite few player that have had better nba career than manu that will never make the hall ,0
indelible ,0
wa the best ever before his knee injury used quite few game back then sat close enough hear timmy talkin shit too with that whine his voice mon boy let boy mon boy ,0
just and cleveland ,0
wonder will change his opinion when the lakers out the second round ,0
what doe that have with lebron being mentally weak also they lost that series game wa meaningless ,0
long time mavs fan still trying wrap head around dirk le team know luka will get better and continue what doe haleluka the team also signed lot fan favorite that will only get better with more like kleber and brunson and powell the entire season the shoulder tbh don trust that with his past injury but hope prof wrong just cannot stomach any more dirk comparison ,0
yeah but bill russell different universe than kawhi leonard laugher ,0
winning season ,0
overrated giannis still think amazing just not top player yet underrated john collins ha obvious fault but feel one ever talk about him ,0
wa fringe role player his entire career clearly respected shooter hold the still think highly regarded role player but never carried team and wa defensive liability thus would say regarded appropriately for his career player don really see anyone talking down that there are conflicting opinion about him coach though ,0
don think stay too think leave question for what team after the fiasco get the sense that player don want just join another player team they want the guy interesting see where end ,0
dang got some good lucky gene ,0
contract aside jeff teague and nicolas batum ,0
look the title the post doe that look like talking about the past wtf you want read for the eastern conference got little bit better well not just you ,0
got magic and heat ,0
doubt jpg ,0
heat are probably lock too ,0
spur beating okc ,0
bro barely aged either ,0
there something incredibly jarring about seeing woman over foot tall wa international job fair recently and saw woman who wa the range she wa easily foot taller than most the woman and good portion the men there can imagine seeing legit foot tall woman would like ,0
wa two way contract course had low played game but when doe play play as off and make the right play there reason why ha full contract now ,0
cena probably legit and obviously well north lol ,0
raptor gsw kawhi beat curry and ,0
anyone but the lakers ,0
the cavs won game made the ecf had second all star averaging just under night and had capable role player that helped form the best defence and best offence the league but then the playoff the talent around the star collapsed sometimes role player can only get you far think lot superstar eventually just want second superstar the buck have done amazing job fielding team around giannis without second one but they get bounced again because the role player impact doesn translate the playoff wouldn surprised history repeated itself ,0
going miss him much wa ecstatic when signed with okc right after did looking forward see how doe with the nugget ,0
you see the chubby white boy behind the point line you better respect also please stop running around much old fuck and not trying die today ,0
damn after seeing literally everyone hate simmons would thought would underrated ,0
kevin garnett wa averaging around during his prime argument could made his prime wa better than tim ,0
how doe mentally weak person come back from deficit skip ,0
you act like dude blob something for his age size pretty good damn shape http www dailymail tvshowbiz article nba legend shaquille oneal go shirtless pair electric blue trunk html just tall and built like linebacker ,0
manu ain white ,0
this the mindset small child ,0
kawhi defensive versatility compliment total lack ball ,0
,0
disagree sabonis the clear better offensive player brown provides more spacing but sabonis way better everything else scored higher rate over higher had over double the assist brown had the much better offensive rebounder and also very smart screener and almost always great position defensively brown certainly better but honestly think pretty overrated that end look like should elite and his ball defense really strong this lead people believe little better than his team defense though leaf lot desired would probably take brown over sabonis due potential but imo sabonis currently the better player ,0
heat magic ,0
you could just widen the rim inch two ,0
chris webber held back because his entire college career wiped off the book because all the under the table money issue that hadn happen would guessing webber would already the hof ,0
agree one your young player way overrated but isnt brown ,0
just wish would just acknowledge that learned shoot with the wrong hand and just get the switch his actual dominant hand started ,0
that small quick asian guy that only know how slash and dash and turn the ball over ,0
that spot where the really young poster this sub get confused they try paint evil owner heroic player when people are cheering for franchise they sometimes invested decade their emotional life ha nothing with cheering for anyone based the amount money they have ,0
could point you shoot hard enough ,0
mean performance wise not just the two most talented ,0
preseason truffle ,0
not picking you but seeing lot people say they defend and rebound when play see none that from almost anyone see other dude hitting from trying curry ,0
piston and hornet ,0

think pelican lack shooting and spacing will frustrating watch maybe not date the pelican roster but reddick pretty much the only reliable shooter the team right would say rocket warrior lakers clipper er will fun watch ,0
which mean for lot guy miami over minnesota ,0
think the heat are gonna top seed not sure why people are putting the pacer lock when their best player gonna miss the first half the season and will likely take awhile not the rest the year get back form ,0
play like fvv except shorter can shoot can playmake can defend worse conditioning and not good looking basically hustle like crazy for first two possession defense and then gassed ,0
you realise there have been people that height before right and none them had any business playing professional basketball tacko barely nba player chuck more inch and hardly able move liability every time defense the opposition would chuck him pick and roll pop every time offense the defender would just push him around his knee would perpetually fucked again there reason people that tall don ball ,0
hope dad with that temperament fan big chest ,0
idk maybe his high school coach ,0
piston and bull maybe piston magic being biased bull fan going with chicago and detroit ,0
lot what you said make sense but also besides the point the core issue that lot people have that behind the scene carmelo anthony did not enjoy jeremy lin taking his spotlight which different from not liking jeremy lin and ama ha backed that well believe different happy the court and off the court although definitely telling sign most the time again agree with all your point about team chemistry and how the roster wa built but don think that mutually exclusive with melo feeling don really know the story either mostly through various article but always got the sense that multiple people went out and implied ,0
hard play injured player minute tho ,0
your main guy are healthy and you the hunt for playoff spot for part the season there basically chance barring lot injury that the mavs are going seed possible bunch team get bunched together but going the really good team the mavs almost certainly would different tier they the hunt for the playoff all ,0

eric bledsoe this his prime not good enough now won two year bledsoe ha got show something this upcoming year the playoff yeah problem shit the bed the playoff again doubt about however not like being mean the mental side your game start declining not great shooter any stretch but isn from bad either even just shot closer his regular season instead would have been different series tor term defense finishing the rim and taking care the ball had the best year his career and don think foregone conclusion that can expand that get over his playoff yip brook lopez same go for him not gonna get any better these next two year why doe lopez need get better already amazing fit with giannis and don really see why his game would decline significantly all from now until when trailing transition and parking behind the point line most his offense and defense mostly just play drop coverage say his game isn dependent athleticism understatement george hill hill already the decline but still very valuable role player but two year likely not gonna much help the hill contract make uneasy couple year down the road agree but seriously doubt untradeable and become the deciding factor whether bring someone else not plus really like him bledsoe insurance policy ersan ilyasova role player now and two year likely won getting any meaningful minute only guaranteed for this upcoming season not really important also probably lol know lot people and almost all buck fan take any post about why giannis would leave hate but don get how couldn concerned not concerned because giannis two year from free agency and there really isn any point bring concerned about leaf then leaf put really good team around him and ha great chance make that final appearance that you feel necessary condition for him staying just wanna enjoy real tough spot for the buck but they did contribute this somewhat choosing not keep brogdon ultimately wish kept brogdon but you know those cap issue with middleton and giannis supermax not overpaying guy who wanted bigger role elsewhere avoiding the repeater tax and getting pick back fine way mitigating whatever damage might come about from letting him which really don think will much people make sound sometimes basically opinion this the buck don make final appearance these next two year they got shot keep giannis cause their will upside for him stay besides the whole supermax thing where get the biggest contract any player ha ever signed honestly following your logic conclusion not even winning final would keep him here and might well just trade him now ,0

they have they eliminated the hand check ,0
spacejam ,0
they pretty much have the end the day all athleticism come down genetic variation and you start the path banning people because they too far out that norm you set really dangerous precedent going forward however given that this hypothetical player would make the current ruleset basketball utterly outdated guess that they let him run rampant for single season before doing some serious overhaul maintain the competitive aspect the game otherwise the final devolves into who can convince this player play for them not sure exactly what they could but they almost certainly something least try contain him while still keeping the appeal his otherworldly athleticism also imagine they would permanent fixture the dunk contest literally every year their career ,0
kobe didn actually know wa starter but really kobe being all star starter that season major evidence for why shouldn rate all time player based all star appearance and don care that wade wasn chosen coach you the one that started talking about coach with your snarky comment all said wa that there are some reserve who probably did not deserve make wade ,0

every heat fan ha wanted whiteside gone for year and half for how effect teamwide play both side the ball watch upwards heat game season please don act like you know more about team than defense relies heavily the eye test because most stats for are absolutely shit and even following those stats whiteside wasn important you think wa literally been benched for being targeting defense team switching him onto smaller faster center wa unplayable the fourth quarter against most team whiteside used really good then two thing happened stopped trying and the game stopped needing big slow interior defense oriented center ,0

everyone had the celtic lock because they had kyrie and hayward coming turn out they did fuck all don have any change anywhere near that significant unless you think wes matthew about kyrie level locker room disaster hayward level waste time which seems somewhat unlikely and nobody overlooked the raptor the consensus wa that they were top two along with the celtic kawhi returned form which wa big question mark because just come off year long injury soon wa clear wa fine they were considered lock and proved everybody right ,0

agree that brogdon going big miss but the top the east look weaker personally toronto lost kawhi and whilst they are still going good team begs the question who will lead them crunch time philly will have problem with spacing and will hugely reliant richardson harris and horford from the outside the celtic have kanter their centre and defensively just too porous that coupled with the fact that kemba walker seems lesser version kyrie ball dominant who doesn fit into brad steven ball movement philosophy ,0

klay thompson injured and won play most the season all when return unclear even the same player initially angelo russell wa injury replacement eastern conference all star and doesn fit together very well with steph especially defensively draymond green wa not all star caliber player last season and will have much more impactful the regular season steph curry obviously great but fragile and will injury risk now that ha handle even higher load the regular season and outside those really since klay will out their roster really really bad ,0
well that make sense you never had ,0
whiteside expiring just ride the bench for month then walk ,0
toronto and boston team will always have some sort rivalry and the case the nhl that extends pretty much all eastern canada ,0

didn say not gonna stand out just said the original comment that literally the tallest person china wa big hyperbole could just walk for popular area beijing and probably see dude within min ,0
tbf the nba becoming more international guy like porzingis doncic embiid jokic simmons etc will have reason place big market team over toronto without any personal tie the state ,0
love butler and just glad guy like hims out there the league say what you want about him but bet for sure make the playoff and even first round bye one going want that match ,0
think the pacer might surprise people the bad way see ton red flag lost key veteran collison young bogdanovic their replacement brogdon lamb warren are collectively not good though like how the team younger now oladipo will likely miss large chunk the beginning the season brogdon also ha health concern dating back college and ha missed regular season game over the last two season sabonis will the starting but not fit guard most the defensive drop off from young sabonis severe they have small forward and will really struggle guard the league best forward lamb and justin holiday are undersized primarily sg warren not good defender and more anyway and mcdermott poor defender well ,0

two thing how winning chip and potentially ending the modern dynasty only enough make the rap semi relevant last checked any team that regularly make the playoff and go good run relevant unless course that bar got changed while wasn looking didn say steph made the dub relevant said wasn just steph the rest the team important too you don win without guy like draymond bogut livingston team sport and while you need superstar like steph and kawhi win title those superstar cannot ever carry team championship their own ,0
case you haven seen this before one the best opening cinematics got goosebump first time saw and still watch from time time http www youtube com watch xwzbmtjam ,0

even net fan shame see him leave you guy you guy had ran back you would been the clear cut favorite make out the east this season ,0
not saying agree with who you replying but culture individualism obviously different from china ,0
couple thing another team can only get year guaranteed from another team but from the rap meaning sign offer sheet the rap get shorter contract than they might want http nba com news why hasnt pascal siakam signed extension with the toronto raptor yet kdi wau xqb the jazz found themselves similar situation with hayward the raptor with siakam and they chose let hayward play out his contract and test free agency instead signing him five year extension that decision led him offer sheet with the charlotte hornet the summer which the jazz matched but paved the way for hayward test free agency again this time unrestricted free agent three year later result hayward left the jazz for the boston celtic just when the franchise appeared turning corner the jazz rebounded way nobody could have foreseen they were fortunate draft donovan mitchell with the pick the same summer hayward left but impossible predict the raptor having the same fortune siakam were follow hayward footstep which case the raptor run the risk seeing siakam walk entering the prime his career not getting deal done now they wait and pascal make all nba team suddenly siakam becomes more expensive siakam eligible for baseline percent the salary cap year salary which project pay him million over five year make all nba team this year win mvp defensive player the year then eligible for percent the cap which would pay him million five year deal can negotiate that raise percent the extension ben simmons and jamal murray have already done with their respective team this offseason the rap can max siakam for year they sign him before the season siakam sign offer sheet next year will year player option meaning the rap lose contract year siakam make all nba team the max will cost the rap year ,0
that too but interaction usually have flow and continuity hence why seeing man like westbrook not knowing what get show some ridicule but anyways cashier are going away soon waste job focus the individual letting the customer make decision their time ,0

they still have steph and draymond the warrior barring injury are probably the best the league ,0
still look like teenage mutant ninja turtle ,0
different difference ,0
not all prevents public statement lebron can still invite player dinner and workout and say whatever all prevents paul george exposing kawhi recruiting him still going happen yes will hear about publicly would people still believe that spur fucked kawhi injury instead kawhi wanted out can play with whomever chooses and lure away from other team some will and some won ,0
went the playoff and played better than harden ,0
waiter are expendable dragic okay but nothing special and would big upgrade ,0
pull the trigger the amare stoudemire trade from the deal wa reportedly wally sczerbiak hickson and first round pick for prime amare pair with lebron apparently the cavs didn make the deal because they didn want mess with the team chemistry fair that team overachieved the tune record and record home none that really matter though when couldn get out the east final make that deal could have rolled out williams delonte west lebron amare big think would have hurt our depth little but could have maybe staggered lebron and amare bit have bench lineup around amare during lebron rest time overall just go back the old bill simmons adage you always turn four quarter into dollar you can amare wa legit star this point and trading for him could have been the difference not only the east final but the nba final and lebron free agency ,0
but would his different have ,0
mean wa shooting with the best spacing the league idk how good post achilles will facing actual adversity ,0
carried the offensive burden this year and still defended the better player the other team even the playoff westbrook wa avoiding dame and ,0
nice headband ,0
that alright man everyone got their thing need force yourself ,0
rus ain elite scorer especially not during the time the year that matter most ,0
loses early the east playoff will blame the warrior for throwing early and exposing him since won able lead yet another team the guy ,0
but muh mamba mentality ,0
,0
feel though portland got weaker losing aminu and harkless whiteside give them amazing depth underneath houston might have gotten much worse best case they what they were last year rus actually change his game for houston they might actually better just see chance that actually happens ,0
west team will eat each others win column will probably like where each team will have but one above ,0
just imagine some timeline kyrie left the warrior instead ,0
mean wa able easily dominate found way that worked for him easy ,0
hold just switched jjs and got confused ,0
wa like three year lmao ,0
stop len bias from partying after getting drafted runner stop the celtic from hiring rick pitino ,0
the thing about the listed height that know that they all over the place some are true and others don account for shoe and bare foot and some shoe differ sole thickness know nike for sure are inch and half see when the height are listed ,0
hey now that wasn this decade but yeah damn crazy think how those two play might changed overall basketball history melo carry that team unexpected title over the magic definitely would team somewhere right now and wouldn memed much billups legacy also much more decorated there legitimate second great chapter his career after the dominant piston team the flip side think there would much larger group people who would saying that kobe wa just scorer who couldn win all without shaq obviously maybe they still win the next year but doubt sorry probably doesn help all that just said all that but really think situation like that are just interesting think about ,0
gotta admit wa bit scared when first got him turn out pretty complete player not really great anything but solid all around even occasionally let him run the offense and wasn terrible ,0
holding people from other country trying come mean you can just let everybody come don think anyone argues that ,0
culver had the same eye popping ability zion imo obviously zion different level but culver wa also guy you noticed second into the game who the most talented player the court wa and stayed that way big mentality and will win guy when watch sport because that the true separator imo the court you have for the jugular the time ,0
this look like screenshot ,0
speaks with his hand very well ,0
the way micromanages team much much worse than goodell maybe goodell suck with his punishment but silver much more tyrannical and force team and coach literally what want much worse ,0
believe kat hollow stats man ,0
should not that list begin with ,0
timmy play toss teammate hey timmy you got lot money build some tank and goliath ,0

brady suspended for game ,0
that you think stats ppg then you too stupid even bother with any further discussion from now just making fun how ridiculously stupid you are ,0
and feathery don forget feathery ,0
someone who can play high level will always respect the opinion someone who play ball ,0
magic had longevity and been around public perception for longer bird won mvp row his prime and wa better shooter and defender while still being great passer his all around game heavily overlooked these comparison ,0
you wrong ,0
kevin love also elite boxouts dude ha some insane lower body strength and know how use that as think they did whole sport science episode his rebounding back the day ,0
west steph and harden are all better offensively than kobe guard hope you realize there more offense than scoring ,0
all milwaukee and greece bought them ,0
http imgur com ,0
you could make argument for over kobe but steph over kobe lmao imagine you gave prime kobe draymond iggy and klay you might have the greatest team offense and defense ever ,0
definitely our weakest link defense that not say bad defender but more just average defender anything ,0
issue because ha developed this weird tendency where the hitch his shot becomes really apparent disappears not metaphorically literally just vanishes then reappears different team crazy ,0
say stupider not fact ,0
weird thing about this reply the next one after wa literally listing few player that became nba ref ,0
this dumb you want speed the game start with timeouts ,0
maybe the team around him wasn as wouldn have left ,0
eric bledsoe wa bad signing khris middleton isn championship quality either the team doe look pretty good but kind doubt they can all the way ,0
looking online adam might have inch him but not much more than that imgur wasn being bitch the moment upload direct but this sbnation article ha good photo the two standing next each other http www sbnation com nba nba score kevin durant russell westbrook andre roberson clash thunder warrior ,0
can tell you serious but always told people wa shorter than actually wa his coach wouldn try force him play ,0
pretty sure that the medium and the nba are doing whatever they can promote him order strengthen and open new market revenue maybe just the salty rocket fan but really believe that whether not giannis actually had better season than harden wa going win anyways with how good the west now and with lebron leaving the east the nba needed find another king the east secure profitability the market that conference not only that european and openly fond his african heritage can single handedly open and secure more market two different continent guy like harden lebron and curry already have secure fanbases and market the nba need look towards their tam total available market want grow giannis big part this growth the end the day the nba business the medium business they both gonna what they can increase the profitability they respective business and giannis this point time doe just that ,0
can tell you never watched the game nba code for don have point lamar odom wa better than anyone not named tim duncan the spur straight better than rookie tony parker over the hill robinson plenty those spur player wound being good but that run wa the biggest individual carry job ever seen bar none ,0
you have pair favorite shoe performance wise all time alongside the lebron wondering should cop another pair try different number the series ,0
lit ,0
yes forgot his name but there wa ref who wa drafted and said and barklet used make fun him for being bust ,0
ben mclemore also showed and asked for his kobe challenge ,0
great story bro ,0
they didn pay middleton retain middleton talent they paid middleton retain giannis talent giannis might not have directly said keep middleton gone two year but the two are clearly bud and loyalty appears mean lot giannis basically the whole buck off season wa appeasing giannis they signed his league talent brother too ,0
shit had idea should awful game tho ,0
ppl reacting him comin big the playoff ,0
preach brother the best regular season team all time lose then join them and yeah they absolutely catered his style play gotta get consult with mwp psychiatrist because something ain right with him people say gotta lead his own team chip get the respect approval apparently desperately seek agree with those people but will never forget stop criticizing his decision leave okc join gsw ,0
ha above average efficiency thats also higher than spidas and lukas efficiency all player are bad defender actually think beal might decent defender but cant remember wa pretty good the playoff ,0
microsoft wa super hamstrung when steve ballmer took over because the anti trust lawsuit that hit the late and when landed turned out huge resource sink keep secure got attacked constantly navigated all that and got the company out that hole relatively unscathed sure had huge major failure like mobile and web strategy but also had huge huge success with azure office xbox etc think the company easily could have fallen into obscurity with all those existential threat but didn lot the thing that nadella get realize success were initiative started under ballmer such cross platform office and huge org right before left for the record think ballmer stepping down wa absolutely the right move and nadella doing excellent job having microsoft exciting thing again ,0
just went back college haha hard for relate student people think but and grew hanging out with people older than best friend wa year older brother have none the same interest experience the people who are interested like older woman too that kinda suck ,0
,0
lean yes for him put stats early got his title and overall well liked the medium ,0
why the world sleep this man after beating devastating injury can understand solid asset any team eye ,0
ken probably feel lucky have job all this point can only play single character with varying degree racial stereotype not going rock the boat and lose this gravy train ,0
hornet win ,0
inconsistent hate the detractor ,0
ben gordon honestly looked like jordan those game ,0
doe kobe actually have the superior array offensive tool steph ha the better handle and touch addition the agreed upon efficiency and course everyone always forgets passing offensive tool ,0
kobe doesnt have solo effort ring remotely close duncan say won commitee joke also duncan just had better career ,0
and thought wa the only one who noticed this someone could inch taller than four inch and struggle notice huge difference ,0
hate reading this ,0
never knew that ,0
lot other sport use former player ref the nhl us former player because they have able skate and protect themselves same thing with the nba joe smith didn play the nba his brain can handle and show ,0
holy shit lmao ,0
don agree that transcendent talent overcomes defensive prep all you have look the playoff see that when all the chip are the table scheme trump skill the patriot rarely have any stud and brady not physically dominant like some other qbs but still wreck the league skill can definitely help overcome prep but that definitely not the norm imo ,0
you play more post watch some clip olajuwon teaching kobe lebron carmelo etc don even need ball practice the footwork andre miller pretty crafty without being supernaturally quick dwyane wade close enough and ha good move starting from the perimeter the post ,0
imagine you gave curry prime shaq ,0
what you mean ,0
wasn mirotic hailed one the better trade deadline acquisition the time really weird how that turned out the end had feeling that mirotic wouldn any good when discovered the buck basically relegated him stretch big role like the bull used role where always been notoriously inconsistent and unreliable seems like the pelican and post butler bull got lot more mileage out expanding mirotic offensive role ,0
popularity for what don envision many people just rocking them for streetwear you mean among nba player ,0
did you miss the part where this the court for the houston rocket professional nba team ,0
they nike branded too hilarious ,0
exactly this bro they know what there doing ,0
even still well over lb ,0
micheal jordan isn dead ,0
it without shoe still probably ,0
luka forward technically ,0
name check out ,0
these workout video will tell you melo current top player too ,0
hey look that mayor http wikipedia org wiki kane wrestler ,0
dude watch the game man idk what tell you look both roster and you actually think the lakers had better roster with smush parker luke walton kwame brown etc then you did not watch the game ,0
doe actually have bad attitude doe just look like doe ,0
duncan had the better longevity although that not totally all kobe his injury really cost him the last few year his career duncan wa quietly one the best defensive player all time duncan wa the better all around player his prime duncan wa extremely good playoff clutch performer ,0
wow old commercial that not funny interesting let all upvote that ,0
speed the game make the fouling bullshit end game more decisive good rule ,0
don worry filled for you ,0
oldest trick the book ,0
got beat tho lmao ,0
how tall westbrook ,0
team that had lead over the warrior the western conference final the very same season the warrior won game as ,0
belichick will talk and all day actually known for praising their opponent before game day also doe film breakdown pretty regularly just doesn deal with bullshit question ,0
this garbage take that literally ruin team signing player huge deal because one series with one matchup sign that you are shit team brogdon wanted leave bledsoe better than him really not tough decision ,0
team that playoff team without him wa as ,0
think kds height change every time you measure him ,0
that why left the warrior ,0
curry ha esque season without the help klay iggy and livingston and drag them the seed entirely possible dray ha also regressed since then pretty big carry job ,0
hilariously ludicrous ,0
rozier gonna drop ,0
thought wa way more than dozen like that know about ,0
true forgot about them losing him they can flip sabonis for legit forward perhaps from the knicks they really solid ,0
lmaooo this dude cant serious watch some old game before bed time son would defend the best guard opposing team night after night just because didnt get flashy block doesnt make him bad defender ,0
can wait see what chris paul doe all the big men the league once know for realsies ,0
don like this you got fouled point shoot free throw simple enough why change the high pressure making these shot win the game great this saying that you get fouled point miss you make the one free throw count for three ,0
yeah theory wa three second and thon maker who requested trade for mirotic should have been great even been normal inconsistent bull mirotic have been guy are bad sometimes not like some the guy already had were super consistent but that ecf performance wa inexplicable wa hard significantly worse than bledsoe that series but least bledsoe had the good sense not bomb away when knew wasn shooting well mirotic just kept chucking ,0
make the win first that way people aren fouling the end game and both team are going hard the entire game ,0
yeah should apply all game reduce delay ,0
look like they weigh advanced stats lot different people weight different stats differently whatever metric they decided are appropriate probably led their decision ,0
revisionist comment but ,0
you will always make more you are younger regardless status the league ,0
shitty foul shooter will hacked left right and center you have such great shot getting foul shot miss defensive rebound fuck sake such dumb idea ,0
thanks for the correction ,0
mac wa beautiful ,0
kobe fan are the most low poster this sub ,0
take mitchell over luka but that just ,0
ryan anderson colorblind as fuck all once again ,0
jaylen brown regretting the haircut already ,0
that just because you don understand lol there not another game where strategy important football ,0
wow reggie evans really out here all time list what one dimensional legend ,0
because free throw are too valuable this would lower for percentage ,0
what incredible argument ,0
the wall worked for three reason giannis can hit three high rate better clog the paint and protect the rim giannis isn good shooter better clog the paint and foul him than try stop him where gonna get and anyways and yes you are absolutely correct his teammate had bad series and couldn score either but the gimmick employed against had absolutely nothing with weakness curry offensive game curry himself balled out not sure how you equating these two thing ,0
won more championship mvp fmvps team all nba and team all defense selection ,0
quicken loan hardly predatory business but not going argue with you guy trump supporter which make him clown book but overall been good owner for the cavs ,0
didn have another mvp with him ,0
that actually very true heard people diminish the warrior success ton time however hear ton people acting like wasn integral part their success while claiming the raptor have asterisk their title the same breath yes believe the warrior are great team but when they lost their depth they became significantly worse team and had they not signed don believe they would won another ring wa integral part their success and golden state probably wouldn have won another ring without him ,0
just being honest lol ,0
there way without shoe genuinely shocked ,0
too enjoyed the new tiger wood pga your game ,0
maybe okc shouldn have tried make harden take pay cut lol ,0
knicks bad ,0
spur looked like championship team because they could just have lockdown defense built around timmy and long they scored some point they fine you took duncan off that team would have been one the worst the league one that team could score for shit kobe lakers would also have been one the worst the league without him but didn elevate them championship level duncan did that for his cast ,0
for good reason ,0
been long bro just wanna watch some nba again ,0
stats probably curry ha lot outlier that stand out which why chosen over kobe usually what they when they want objective kind annoying imo since not everyone weighs the same stats nor they weigh them equally ,0
dale elli make blindfolded pointer this day ,0
there really such large group people clamouring wear ninja headband irl never seen anyone just wear one person but also haven seen ninja person mean guess there are people who wear regular nba sweatband for fashion too nothing that weird ,0
where all goin stream the game ,0
and happens that way all the time see someone think huge and when they get close taller ,0
half court sniper ,0
ohhh that where that cry kid from ,0
dwayne johnson ,0
don care what anyone say ,0
first point wrong kobe wa better the tail end his career than wa not even close second point could also made for kobe kobe also ha more all defensive first team selection than duncan third point just wrong fourth point moot because kobe wa much better statistically the playoff than duncan again not even close ,0
because will lead him scoring le like you gonna rebuild your shot from the ground why not make good shooting form ,0
buck would mean giannis nearing final form want see ,0
really wa though many deep and mid range fadeaways ,0
think today game this near impossible defense this era very complex and one man show are pretty much shut down they have work really hard get ,0
yea but soon real game start his butt pucker like spongebob sunlight ,0
fga ,0
ive been calling myself foot for year went the doctor the other day find out wish coulda lived ignorance ,0
sorry but whats the problem with tony parker averaged and and somehow duncan carried averaging point thats not carrying thats called good coaching and good surrounding player ,0
doubt pretty tall and after while becomes curse ,0
ope ,0
don ,0
you don understand thing hey ,0
nah ,0
this sound like will called the harden rule lol ,0
apparently malik wa there too ,0
think lower than top and also probably rapist ,0
draymond need anymore chip his shoulder telling him like his perfect cell ,0
what terrible cut lol ,0
tom from park and rec not detlef fault entertainment went bankrupt ,0
realistically feel like there wa probably little hindsight there like man could had many woman wanted then married with kid and get caught wa single there would been scandal all and continues dominate ,0
unsubscribe ,0
don ,0
personally think top love the kobe jellybean bryant ,0
the fact that kobe new facility thousand oak very kobe ,0
the team that probably wouldn want trade with the clipper anymore atm ,0
because haven seen him his prime ,0
way lebron isn number one landslide also lot older player who the youngun wouldn have clue ever existed ,0
had small victory sport medium finally not saying tatum better then booker can respect the mitchell claim atleast they have substance behind them ,0
whether people want admit not recency bias and fear being downvoted lead group think and only look analytics drive their perception current player like steph but never even bothered watch old clip kobe ,0
thats inch thats double what they said ,0
brb looking for gameboy colour ,0
that the tinder footer ,0
shox were uncomfortable compared the zigzag shoe reebok put out sometimes wonder why people fall for celebrity endorsement ,0
tim hardaway ,0
yes ,0
yeah but even after that explanation you still know your own height doesn really explain how someone doesn know their own height ,0
take bron and over steph and and klay honestly ,0
kissed tiger wood impersonator shoney once ,0
chris paul being gonna good time ,0
add those inch from his shlong his height ,0
but you did get dozen nugget ,0
for one not ready see huge increase under player not willing face the reality that the reason didn play basketball even college level isn that too short because lazy ,0
should shoot the first for two miss and you have shoot the remaining shot for ft you miss one you have shoot for the next one for you make the first you still have shoot one more you miss the first one you have shoot two more ,0
gambling ,0
about pull and ,0
give respect beal would say his prime right now and pretty darn good ,0
because sun fan ,0
and the hornet ,0
bird the word ,0
and kobe got older carried more the load for the team idk what that dude talking about ,0
like those number aren really better than giannis regular season number are they playoff are weighted more heavily because you constantly playing the best team you don get put easy point the sun shooting kawhi did this against the fucking er team with the best defensive lineup the league mile their starting lineup drtg the playoff wa ninety interesting how giannis killed the and then his efficiency dropped the playoff because wa constantly facing elite team everyone that top tier ha bonkers stats kawhi don really stand out compared other great playoff run look how many guy have ever put the stats kawhi did during this playoff run just the point and efficiency ignore his and clutch shooting hint only ever been done time you count only those who even made out the round time once once kareem twice lebron kawhi did this bum leg and won the chip tell again how doesn stand out among other playoff run ,0
damn just fried last brain cell reading this goodbye cruel world ,0
after this last off season anyone with negative news about the lakers immediately branded career hack and lying grifter the nephew here ,0
wish could see the time clock know these shot were under pressure because impending shot clock violation see actually ha the green light shoot these ,0
kawhi his burner forgot switch account ,0
off the bench because that still leaf dudley backup unless doe plus dudley lucky play game year just really poor preparation cause lebron and should probably some sort minute restriction not full blown load management but with little depth behind them doesn look like that possible ,0
ha two ring now completely different conversation although wa integral part the warrior dynasty never treated like ha win elsewhere and will brooklyn ,0
you probably still shit but will work anyway ,0
retirement kobe need stop making like him much just remind yourself that rapist whose victim attempted suicide twice ,0
earl wa green beret ,0
evidence ,0
stop you are violating the law tiktok ,0
but then you realize that oladipo actually doe have reputation for being good singer remember correctly sang the national anthem some point front crowd ,0
the game against the raptor were the game that mattered you want keep giannis ,0
like traditional big but not like traditional big all with his skill lol ,0
crushed dream and sexual predictor ,0
rgv viper have promo with local tamale place and gotta say awesome ,0
those same people trusted arye abraham and rdambition ,0
think most people underestimate the height their forehead well that dude foot and yeah staring him but the top head like inch just tall him ,0
remember before the draft people were trying tell lol ,0
sure wasn the first suggest this but did suggest provenance ,0
funnily enough hadn played one the all time bad final series against the cavs then they win durant never come and the dub pay him ,0
just clarify are you trying argue that form doesn matter for shooter don agree about steph but kind irrelevant there will always exception and player like kevin martin can shoot with bad form because still go fultz can shoot with bad form because doesn fultz obviously isn exception ,0
purely because said good thing fact don matter anymore all about how the news you read make you feel ,0
just watch the performance and not listen the judge ,0
maybe thought wa opposite day ,0
appreciate the effort but this post kinda trash lol almost all the explanation make zero sense ,0
that tough call hard predict since luka going into his second year might improve lot and mitchell might improve lot with more offensive help around him ,0
cool ,0
can the game start already fuck soo close ,0
not even close the listed maybe you count his hair ,0
alright man have fun having the ceiling seed the next year ,0
hey happens awhile back forgot the nba really doe jump ball instead posession arrow ,0
good shit lol love the traded description also there are dratinis ,0
stop playing with drip thank god these guy are good playing basketball because they are painfully uncool ,0
you can flop shot late the shot clock and then you get free throw worth point ,0
they didn even include alex english honorable mention anything wa the leading scorer the and all star regarded the best nugget ever and ha many the franchise record english lead the nba scoring for entire decade yet decided instead name current guy like kyle lowry paul millsap jimmy butler and horford honorable mention and left him out ,0
caron butler ,0
tbh don get that one ,0
yeah they are tough spot they don really have time retool this whole thing and had overpay keep their guy unfortunately doesn really look like this core they put together good enough win giannis might bail anyway but who know maybe good enough carry them all the way ,0
what lazy statement make lol ,0
two dratini are you fucking kidding jeremy ,0
seen the best tape both guy and larry just look better wa magician ,0
replace with jambalaya and baby got our leonardo ,0
beal booker mitchell luka think beal ha small margin top and booker and mitchell are both neck and neck could flip them and wouldn against proven his prime luka still ha prove that insane upside before the best ,0
lepoleon bronparte ,0
love curry not there yet kobe ha been range for while now one day hope curry crack top but not there yet current issue you replace curry with prime kobe those final loss are they win not sure but possibility don think curry done maturing player definitely ha the ability beat kobe the all time list the end his career however not there yet ,0
ha slightly better efficiency than luka and mitchell that all have though ,0
the more likely scenario that you lose all your coordination meaning you also lose all your guard skill and you end lanky boi with skill ,0
homophobic you sure you the right place this sub super homoerotic not homophobic ,0
idk how many have measured shoe not but maybe lot these player are measured shoe ,0
begging people praise lowry ,0
damn really ,0
that big spain barcelona now ,0
deleted lmao wa response the guy question http twitter com kdtrey status below the kobe one for some reason deleted the response but said steph top all time best shooter ever changed the game ,0
the way you putting word mouth you might well argue with yourself mirror question you always this much baby when you debate irl cause dying over here picturing you have meltdown debate class lol ,0
update your tinder basic input output system ,0
well you put mediocre supporting cast around giannis gone anyway ,0
long it not the lakers good with ,0
serge ibaka sweatin ,0
but ha love child son the other side the globe ,0
wide open dunk way better than wide open lmao even say only dunk make that still expected value you have shoot from for that and demar isn doing that ,0
having lead sound great but reality both team just need win total game series team like golden state who wa ahead their time with the point era could easily make the right adjustment and get the win what could okc counter nothing okc wa behind the time that wa essentially pas rus and and let just stand and watch that doesn work come playoff and with such lacklustre bench what readjustment could they have made win that game ,0
wasn just utah wa the league general shooting just wasn priority and team didn think the pointer wa that valuable even tho there were plenty good point shooter back then korver ray allen rashard lewis jason kapono and many others but back then the top point shooting team the league were only averaging attempt per game antoni knicks and svg magic ,0
before his injury probably the best player the league ,0
for damn sure ,0
you got otto porter and james johnson both pidgeotto don think see hitmonchan though james johnson could hitmonchan since used mma fighter ,0
not really quick through the release but take forever get into his shooting motion watch his shot http youtu kjhym always slowly brings down below his hip and pause for second before quickly flinging out all wonky ,0
perfect player for lebron though strong perimeter defender and someone who will knock down shot ,0
fultz shamble ,0
you got two dratinis and two pidgeottos and you forgot hitmonlee and hitmonchan ,0
the top three pretty much the stock standard top three any all time list ,0
that wa just the spanish flu ,0
and hate all you ,0
what the hell ,0
sir this wendy ,0
can miss you don shoot them the regular season ,0
positive wingspan like that very common the nba the sport naturally selects for since such huge and intangible asset you find few guy le than minus height and durant believe ,0
not just gonna forget how person lol won take that much adjustment ,0
lmao had idea then there the story the lunch which spread throughout the naval special warfare community guy still tell almost decade later tiger and group five six went diner posta the waitress brought the check and the table went silent according two people there that day nobody said anything and neither did tiger and the other guy sort looked one another finally one the seal said separate check please the waitress walked away are all baffled say one seal veteran numerous combat deployment are sitting there with tiger ing wood who probably make more than all combined day shooting our ammo taking our time weird ing guy that weird something wrong with you ,0
wa reportedly different form messing the kid earl wa charge government run brothel nam and kept the atmosphere when told his wife and kid they were getting divorced and took tiger mom back the state reportedly porn wa bascially always playing the wood house and the woman earl wa cheating with were constantly going and out ,0
lmao weak for not saying when top player the league wanted join the warrior the fuck kinda bullshit that ,0
duncan wa team all nba and team all defense kobe wa retired again not his fault his last year were taken from him the achilles injury let honest kobe wa good defender but wasn time all defensive first team good all around yeah duncan could score pas rebound and defend like one ever could his prime outside scoring kobe wasn really better statistically the playoff than duncan ,0
when youre proud but also kinda pissed that someone stealing your look http imgur com zebtb jpg ,0
first all take your bandwagon laker flair off you are disgrace true laker fan second kobe bryant had every shot his bag could take you the post shoot the three mid range and finish the rim overall better offensive player curry probably the best shooter all time but that doesnt make him better scorer offense are way more efficient nowadays with great spacing kobe had the gravity klay thompson kevin durant would unstoppable kobe wa constantly doubled with nowhere near the spacing curry get now curry also shoot twice the three kobe shot and that probably the only part his offensive game that better than kobe ,0
the biggest issue all afraid play game can still decent backup with his current skill set ,0
celtic winning don ,0
what ,0
bud ha never been great game mid series adjustment his strength implementing system and player development tough though when nobody can buy shot and nobody but giannis can even create their own shot begin with ,0
his defense harden turned decent amount head but not enough apparently ,0
think what normal you big part but one closest friend growing and the time were think just being around him regularly when were growing ha skewed opinion what being tall people that are under just don look tall and think because they visibly shorter than friend who benchmark for tall ,0
steph wasn even the best player his team the past year finally the best player his team now ,0
basically giovanni ,0
that doe not sound like live performance all that gotta pre recorded right ,0
mean kinda doe between simmons fultz mcw know lot about guard who can shoot ,0
damn that hookshot tho ,0
old enough have watched kobe from age when him and shaq threepeated wa college when the lakers went back back watched his entire career the kid trope isn valid have bird magic kareem wilt shaq duncan bill lebron top not order btw hakeem kobe oscar curry again not order reasonable that kobe can fall outside that top depending the order especially since and curry have year left build accolade ,0
somebody said got the job because wa part the korean one ,0
surprised out everything you mentioned that positioning didn make the list ,0
damn short ,0
there this thing called defense ,0
not that much difference unless you looking mirror and comparing you few foot away and inch isn that big least that how feel when with someone few inch taller ,0
technically manute bol because most likely played his first game the nba his mid and probably had his best season when wa around ,0
bet this one the best off season post all time but since not native english speaker most pokemons have different name language which make pretty hard ,0
the basic point that impossible come with le interesting basketball play than league free throw there zero cost make this decision ,0
difference one fun summer camp with friend and their idol other tough international tournament that need taken seriously ,0
this actually remake korean show you not far off ,0
yeah because the rest your team embiid horford simmons and richardson team worst defender tobias harris that top defense right there ,0
lmao can just picture you switching account back and forth ,0
have better depth ,0
forget exactly what the user name wa think wa something like snuggle but wa ranting about gold digger and nba player thread longggggg time ago wa hilarious ,0
dumb rule glad they jus testing out ,0
you wave player you can then assign him your league team and cant another team least that what understood from this have clue right not ,0
naw his role just changed ,0
inch pay attention ,0
fast now lol ,0
clarkson gonna learn stop driving like light skin one these day wa just bringing the woman ,0
late game free throw are sometimes insanely tense still remember lebron free throw against the warrior game that wa some intense shit ,0
yeah and friend and when look him really doesn seem that much taller than ,0
durant gonna start his burner ,0
and tbh the lakers fan still found way even saltier towards him once signed with the clipper ,0
edited again need sleep ,0
get will have some effect but even help one team that ha player that shoot free throw better their first shot but who could possibly give shit ,0
what weirder loving kcp icp ,0
that only get and opportunity block because great help defense covering for his as ,0
and had some debilitating back injury that really slowed him down when wa older ,0
mean mitchell wa producing better number once fully recovered from his injury where couldn much basketball wise during the offseason once january hit wa monster ,0
this the whitest shit ive heard all day ,0
this should create uptick youth basketball short people won discouraged from the spot when they find out that the nba shorter than they thought ,0
fixed good call ,0
the faaaaaade that beard ,0
laugh sixer take out our two best player and still roll ,0
point are everything you right duncan sucked ,0
but his bad form the reason can score well shawn marion had terrible form too but his result were still decent fultz ha terrible form and ha terrible result don think anyone would change anyone form their result were good ,0
get the hate get but goddamn ever love that man ,0
believe excited for our defense this season but tobi still isn really anything more than average defender regardless not saying negative defense but doesn seem much positive either ,0
that wrong though without him they haven made out the first round year despite having another superstar replace him mean wrong for him say but not wrong ,0

don know would say his shot had hitch wa more just two motion shot ,0
bodied ,0
you must new here ,0
not necessarily that either ,0
technically player shoot better the and attempt the line the expected point should drop little bit but affect everybody wash ,0
tony parker ha final mvp and hall famer same with ginobili parker wa his second year and ginobili wa his first should without saying that year old david robinson wa beyond washed that point the view the time wa that wa close one man team you could get duncan absolutely carried that team chip kobe second best wa lamar odom odom wa better player than sjax and bowen tbh fwiw think duncan teammate were better than kobe guy but the same time given how good duncan wa that season also think get them into the playoff you swap the two not chip necessarily but playoff sure all are really underestimating how good prime duncan wa ,0
bronashaw jameson ,0
honestly though ton people list their height shoe did test with some people and most were least inch shorter inch and half and rounded clue why people that you everyone can tell that you not ,0
kobe entered the league and undoubtedly had more elite year than duncan you just repeating that because you read blog kobe wa elite defender kobe wa better passer and scorer than duncan literally not even close ,0
evolved from flip flop ,0
look probability you down and free throw shooter step the line old rule assuming the odds that you make free throw are independent another then the odds that free throw shooter hit row new rule the odds that you hit free throw are the new rule have doubled your chance tying the game ,0
not every black stud tiger wood impersonator ,0
with you went into the ymca and saw some guy wearing these would expect them pretty serious ballers your average joe can wear one these without being ridiculed ruthlessly the court while nba caliber player can wear them not sure there massive pent market for ninja style headband course nike marketing strategy these thing will everywhere ,0

people are really bad estimating their height girlfriend like inch shorter than but think she taller than despite constant back back mirror check ,0
think many player have made height that hard tell met finnish pro player listed and wa maybe couple taller than thought wa funny and few minute later saw guy listed they were festival together and wa definitely not taller than would never measure myself and just cluelessly played basketball could think even tall ,0
also well known for being bad tipper think just generally cheap ,0
fourth point moot because kobe wa much better statistically the playoff than duncan again not even close what what stats are you using duncan playoff bpm and per are all better than kobe both career and prime are you just looking ppgs and using that your entire stat analysis something ,0

curry not better than kobe yet but one day with enough stats will better for sure guess might extrapolating few more season for curry the biggest crime hakeem ranked below david robinson that disgrace ,0
duncan and hakeem career number are close they had better prime year playoff and career statistic than duncan and not even close okay let compare hakeem ppg rpg apg stl blk per bpm vorp title fmvp playoff win mvp dpoy all star all nba first team all nba second team all nba third team all nba first team defense all nba second team defense duncan ppg rpg apg stl blk per bpm vorp title fmvp already ha one each playoff win mvp all star all nba first team all nba second team all nba first team defense all nba second team defense basically wash with the slight edge tim duncan you put either them duncan position san antonio the team would better because there way you can possibly know this the entire spur organisation wa built around duncan talent and leadership also simply cannot entertain the thought that durant better than duncan maybe better scorer that ,0

duncan solid top player steph ain yet but may get there the end their career russell hakeem wilt are all solid top guy too frankly any list that ha all those guy and duncan eligible ignoring modern era only list suspect big kobe are frankly debatable top choice some list have them and some don got both just outside personally ain really cut and dried question you think ,0
that still technically true with the current rule where you can miss the first and still make the next two with the new rule you miss the first you get zero point and apparently player shoot better their and attempt the line the point expectancy should actually done ,0
yay thanks can back blaming ancestor and genetics ,0

time for the little frog leave the small pond ,0
you insane you think isn top the only player with legitimate argument over him are michael kareem and maybe magic you really pushing that gonna worst top two scoring finish with least mvp probably end with the most all nba and allstar appearance nba history there also very good chance win least one more title and final mvp you also ignoring context most kareem prime wa during the worst decade modern nba history and wa the best player his six title winning team like three time maximum michael always had better team weaker competition the final well better coaching than lebron ha ever had and magic played with kareem and also had one the greatest coach and collection teammate ever his side not mention the fact that the west the wa awful for the most part outside the lakers ,0
mean while sold hundred pair kawhi championship winning shoe and make ,0
they still have the exact same incentive practice free throw ,0
they both played better than duncan for the entirety their career hell they did not watched all duncan career and fair amount olajuwon take duncan over either and not spur fan dream wa great though ,0
okay guy today gonna learn the bounce pas ,0
lol they want robot ump and mvp renamed the highest war award ,0
more interested they got take the same shot from where they were originally fouled count depending where the shooting foul took place ,0

ain ,0
that encourages fouling though which don want ,0
lebron his age wa dragging much worse team throughout the playoff and putting better stats ,0
kobe king basketball elite ,0
depends what you mean criticism for his basketball play early his career people called him out for his outside shot saying all did wa drive and dunk but during his year not really outside the game basketball people would tell story him being jerk gambling but really didn get himself the limelight like rodman magic would social medium and technology real would looked differently today world because didn want talk about social issue etc but the you either for against very real today sa right with what said wow ,0

klay chance missing the entire regular season therefore trae young will prove more valuable simply being the floor these ranking injured star player always get fan riled because they simply not understand what these particular ranking represent even klay end playing game that still not more valuable than trae playing assumably improved player from last season the last third his rookie season wa pretty phenomenal from the perspective that wa rookie averaged above average and had consecutive game people are still seeing him the same light the first third his season when wa walking meme almost come out doing what did that last third his rookie season course more valuable than klay thompson sitting bench his suit ,0
and that the trick scream lot and then talk real low refuting everything just said sport centrist never actually say anything and people still think hot take artist ,0
for sure ,0
this really good point hadn thought ,0

the last third his rookie season did average ppg along with apg had consecutive game definitely need work his defense though ,0
always thought wa then went the doctor for medical exam and found out solid barefoot can believe all this time wa walking around being close really boosted confidence from that day forward but always realized that there very little albeit noticable difference between guy and guy ,0
tiger dad wa navy seal wa not ,0
this both super bizarre abhorrent and amazing the same time doe still seems grammatically incorrect ,0
well like this you are right the sense that human potential ceiling all facet determined birth but how you determine determination self possible that major advancement science never happened because some genius fried his brain some addiction somewhere possible that some motivated and determined reasonably intelligent person out there dedicated their entire life quest some medical discovery passion pursuit and succeeded the example you gave can say that agree and disagree find high intelligence and natural rhythm more impressive but don always view the individual that posse those trait impressive they use those natural talent and expand them and the result amazing then yes can impressed both their gift and effort but they coast then what impressed natural selection work suppose the end assessed accomplishment and the individual behind them with the same approach that you use there would reason for not support something like eugenics also all take being le than ideal for you cease pursuit self betterment then you are essentially against self improvement any form don know what ideal your opinion but one ideal and are not discussing how ideal they are whether they feel ideal about themselves even someone like the girl from wolf wall street the blonde wife not ideal because even though see zero flaw her physically mean sure that she probably hate something about herself like triangular toenail some shit one ideal using excuse against self improvement like never ending cycle complacency ,0
isn wingspan the very definition tangible ,0
not everyone can ,0
first got little suspicious when reminisced about his service the dominican civil war ,0
one and one doesn mean either them are god levitation above everyone else they both have failing you bring them regard either seen dis fan both because you dismissing their career and focusing what they didn right which kind bullshit and standard human should have live none this mystery why there constant backlash the backlash the backlash etc ,0

jordan and lebron then everyone else really don see appreciable difference you can make argument for lot guy too ,0
the current rule give them free throw nothing really change ,0

beal luka booker mitchell ,0
can wait for donovan mitchell find out ,0
lmao damn you ain have him like that ,0
put simply what point time during their career did anybody say tim duncan wa the best player the world had damn good argument wa him and shaq and pretty much three chip three final mvp and didn really have great supporting cast for fair chunk that time robinson wa past his prime and parker ginobili joined midway kobe wa considered the best player the world throughout both their career lol kobe wasn even considered the best player his team til shaq left you might think wa considered the best player the world throughout both their career but most people did not there were maybe couple year where wa the consensus best but sure hell wasn considered the best when wa missing the payoff and getting knocked out the first round talking who were considered best probably something like shaq duncan kobe lebron that rough draft and the year are probably debatable but point kobe realistically had short period where wa considered the best player the world ,0
are offense against our defense ,0
remember watching mac use his height take shot over rip hamilton tried recreate and practically couldn since they were like inch different ,0
the street foot the sheetz ,0

won row dominant fashion lol wonder why lol dude claiming that duncan win were all down his teammate then bend over backwards avoid acknowledging the fact that kobe wasn even the best player those team come the fuck ,0
because pretty obvious lebron the second best all time you don have him top then you bending the rule the argument and putting someone else above him with similar argument you could put that same person over jordan ,0
yes need all the can get ,0
what can say gotta try for the halfcourt shot sometimes ,0
fatality ,0
yeah the one talking about the one where embiid put and won the game that the purpose that whole basketball thing lost redick but picked horford who can hit and provides excellent defense also picked jrich who can hit and provides excellent defense big loss but wa major defensive hole also you very much exaggerating giannis domination embiid and horford you acting though all his point came while they were his primary defender which simply false regardless giannis can score much want and dominate everybody you lost that game our team ha gotten better yours hasn giannis dominating won singlehandedly win series fact showed last year that can gameplanned for when the raptor beat you straight after took them there are lot great argument for the buck these are the two best team the east yours just isn one them ,0
fuck year younger than steph and year younger than rich could the potential successor steph who probably retire hitting his prime year ,0

dirkstra ,0
kawhi didn much modern day kawhi stuff during that run built over the next few year got better handle neat little jordan esque fadeaway and then finally started doing all the iso and pull jumper stuff ,0
laughed way too hard this ,0
embiid porzingis davis jokic capela nurkic all say different those guy are all the position make you pay for going small and harrell isn big fast enough return the favor and paul george need score you don want him guarding the gonna real issue for the clip because the nba suddenly bigs league and the clip rebounding might pretty suspect ,0
,0
just thought say thoracic outlet real debilitating disorder that taught medical school had legit medical issue that hindered him think just saying now that that behind him can hopefully get back that number one pick level talent really rooting for this dude and hope prof everyone wrong ,0
not necessarily also ha the rare ability ricocheting the ball directly off the side the rim single handedly forcing the nba consider adding protective netting like baseball ,0
clickbait trash ,0
lol dense normal ppl don say kawhi ha mvp they say fmvp final mvp ,0

utah for sure mormon people freaking hate tall black guy but will still their game have idea why ,0
definitely lebron feel like there wa tweet during the playoff after clutch point shot wa made and wa mocking advanced metric ,0
gonna regret this but steph def touched his mouth chin ,0
actually doesn nor hasn told anything except the worry wasted over broke jumper ,0
don have answer for embiid dominates lopez course also not making take out thin air about how good our defence embiid like people are about embiid horford giannis unfortunately take more than one player win game which why giannis put and still lost embiid and you just lost your best shooter and second best performer against not arguing this instance that win the series off the back giannis domination think win the series but laid out reasoning elsewhere arguing that the idea that philly somehow great defensive matchup for giannis when nobody that team ha ever stopped him the regular season playoff nonsense and showing can gameplanned for mean next nothing when different team featuring horford giannis le used that same game plan the series prior and got wrecked you can certainly try but there evidence anyone your team defends him well nor there any evidence that the wall just work whenever because very much did not work the first time wa tried ,0
can comfortably his top everyone else although that isn really something can judge ,0
what else ,0
you have understand some condition under which player won but not others and you the person that decides which condition matter and which don sound fair ,0
why isn charlotte why isn new orleans why isn phoenix lol eew don even compare atlanta and orlando with these other city charlotte new orleans and phoenix are bad destination and also been bad team but orlando atlanta etc are great destination but just not good enough team attract any big fish they are always that not completely garbage get top pick and not good enough make the playoff either category basically stuck the middle new york too even though they did get some lottery pick they just never grabbed anyone that could make difference they had chance this year zion but the basketball god just laughed them once again why doe new york all place can get big free agent they are the richest franchise the league and also fuckin new york the madison square garden and all that epic shit why not how doe the brooklyn net grab kyrie and instead the new york knicks great destination just doesn cut always there many more factor that effect free agent decision especially for superstar free agent ,0
overrated player bad contract seems legit ,0
that fine that you don see happening just saying could happen ,0
just noticed the french team literally irl version this http imgur com vogebbe png ,0
agree with you that fmvp mvp but that doesn make normal say kawhi ha mvp when generally everyone else make distinction calling them mvp fmvp final mvp saying that kawhi ha mvp going against convention ,0
steph disappointed that clip ,0
well only become top when got injured ,0
except rocket are not the rocket player who putting would easily make the difference point game it really not that hard grasp ,0
agree with you that fmvp more important than mvp but that doesn make normal say kawhi ha mvp when generally everyone else make distinction calling them mvp fmvp final mvp saying that kawhi ha mvp going against convention ,0
haven gotten any major material long time gotta work with what got ,0
next big as statue right outside the arena next big as statue right outside the arena there ,0

dense being completely oblivious how other ppl refer mvp and they don say that kawhi ha mvp ,0
like saying know performed badly but wa good enough get into this ivy league school and know and can better here ,0
keep fighting the good fight man ,0
the reason kobe often seen inefficient offense because shot from anywhere which set off the whole rim and three crowd the fact that his injury late his career magnified his shot selection issue and his perceived tunnel vision offense with regard passing his teammate the other hand timmy offense wa effective like kobe bit hampered inconsistent ft just that never developed reputation for hogging the ball because wasn perceived taking touch away from shaq level player both are hurt anyway spending many season their career the pre shot efficiency area and neither known for being sharpshooter from beyond the arc ,0

ha never not won ring his career only took him year tie lebron ,0
doe both the ringer recruited him after seeing his high quality dime drop vids ,0
say what fool ,0
,0
you don understand why this team great defensively there point arguing with you top that you think that giannis performance against great defender while they were different team mean that together they will helpless you need seriously reevaluate you talking about his performance though constantly these player you also acting though his performance against them while they were different team will the same now that they together and now that the sixer defense whole ha gotten substantially bette team defense thing ours got better got better length better interior defense stronger etc everything got better everything that need for player like giannis basketball isn the surface can see where you coming from but you neglecting major aspect this debate either way done arguing point arguing against take like this ,0
how upvote you like time this awesome ,0
not going defend every instance guy getting booed philly but overwhelmingly when fan are booing not because their team losing it because they dragging as same and little boston but little toned back ,0
yeah the top east team get pretty easy round always where the west even the seed put tough fight ,0
vince carter the best dunker nba history period zach lavine aaron gordon and jason richardson are behind him ,0

iggy ha final mvp would you say mvp ,0
that doe look odd ,0
lolknicks ,0
yeah jordan wa wa clyde dominique magic wa but wa not the athlete lebron people era weren athletic because they modeled their game people who were big and that how they played after everyone wanted therefore lebron have had the ball their hand playmaker since they were young ,0
what hilarious this wa preceded some god awful basketball http www youtube com watch wihbbvemppi guy completely loses his dribble then miss wide open layup and then the french make the dumbest spinning look pas ,0
kobe calling card wa his scoring his efficiency par with what doe that really say about his scoring ,0
nah bird ,0
the key reason not down fultz most people game dude hasn even played full season yet obviously going through some shit fair question ready play mental level but there way too small sample size make judgement his skill ,0
wa dragged into playing fantasy football but looking very grim for this season ,0
you just talking shit for reason ,0
having multiple player that consistently make thebal star team one side superteam ,0
can understand how pro basketball player can shoot free throw even with the best trainer and coach available taught myself how shoot with youtube video and shot isn that broken ,0
woj also breaking ben simmons ha taken knee before his season debut the orlando magic during the national anthem the story go tell the reporter that it unfair him that markelle fultz which wa traded for ben simmons earlier this year the sixer listed rookie and not demand listed rookie again compete for the rookie the year award ,0
close none lol why you think hater would watch listen that shit ,0
think doesn help that super tall and lanky ,0
,0
yes take hit never doe anything with the lakers ,0
yeah when guy ignored him went dho with reddick similar what draymond doe ,0
perhaps wa setup for him win because his game dunk were nasty not saying fair but wa true wouldn have that much problem with blake wa murdering grown men national television ,0
off topic markelle fultz look like shiloh dynasty ,0
http imgur com gallery cjxbj ,0
scraight ,0

strike that ,0
these ben joke will get old the minute hit actual game pter ,0
mean just not literally nothing better from point and better the mid range game especially floater and playing with dame yeah beal the option right now beal probably still better ,0
simmons post game got lot better year ,0
from all report yeah ben didn like jimmy and loved tobi mean who doesn love tobi but still ,0
this the quality original content subbed for ,0
like kawhi mvp caliber and ha fmvp but start calling fmvp just fmvp then run into weird shit situation like calling andre igoudala and mvp and that just weird ,0
why the fuck doe everyone completely ignore that yes while these list are generate click buzz blah blah etc etc it projection the next season right wrong literally prediction ,0
like kawhi mvp caliber and ha fmvp but start calling fmvp just mvp then run into weird shit situation like calling andre igoudala mvp ,0
as pretty thicc ,0
not nearly embarassing talking shit without flair ,0
like jab hook ,0
might take bit hit but overall his legacy will forever sealed after that final run ,0
win mvp and lead his team the best record the nba ,0
watched this live with brother and our friend and lost our shit much ,0
based what showcased far not even sure belongs the top ,0
and out dribble left behind the back dribble right stepback stink face camera ,0
chance are slim that don off myself don keep the choice yours danny ,0
like stone cold stunner ,0
only making per employee before any actual cost office space benefit cost good etc seems pretty low but they are growing fast ,0
peak off season content ,0
guess you right peak gsw level team but the team that are competitive are leagueeess better than everyone else ,0
when hit year old whichever come first ,0
texan are definitely king and always will houston just football city ,0
kobe tai tera patrick ,0
probably harden but wa betting based off these odds put money giannis ,0
booker underrated this sub ,0
like the jeremy lamb take you call james harden you could call jeremy lamb even better than even like ,0
can knock the hustle ,0
they usually the sportsnet channel nbatv ,0
yes being tall with even longer wingspan not helpful for dunking this why the best player are short with stub arm ,0
still hate the fact that you get for that let the man have his moment ffs ,0
think people just don have experience with didn know this until talked guy who wa sikh and hadn ever shaved his beard after about inch his beard came together and wa just one long strip hair that went another inch this guy who hadn ever shaved and wa his ,0
what this based kobe averaged more point per game half assist le had the same field goal percentage all nba first team and nba all defensive first team ,0
being great defensively isn the same thing being great matchup against giannis specifically wa constantly against embiid you yourself said much that wa supposed the gameplan yeah not like the celtic had horford surrounded poor defender they very good defensive outfit too and giannis still torched their wall the playoff fully understand basketball isn game but also understand that none the player your team have had any level success primary matchup against giannis and your team whole hasn been able effectively contain our offence any point your logic essentially have bunch good defender therefore this favourable matchup but you should know that not how work last year playoff were great example fact our guard rotation wa much better defensively than yours mostly because didn have redick level defensive disaster but the raptor guard couldn anything against you guy while they torched all series bad bledsoe choked offensively wa still playing solid didn matter though because our matchup and defensive scheme simply weren effective yours the same applies here there nothing that should reasonably lead somebody believe this favourable defensive matchup for philly because both the individual player and the team coaching whole ha never been effective ,0
like bias ,0
but isn the best player and they aren chicken tender ,0
president player association would bad look gave back some money the team somehow ,0
zip code got changed and got year switch over imagine similar during that year could use either the old the new zip code ,0
but for gary payton stockton wa harder gary answer wasn regard everyones ability defend but his own ability defend point that you seem incapable understanding that subtle difference ,0
but which sportsnet there many and can pick them all ,0
you clearly don understand what you saying ,0
that hard argue with ,0
didn realise that had anything with basketball ,0
winning mvp while being runner for dpoty help his argument say his argument top good harden basically seen them dominate the regular season and carry their team crazy way don view harden and above giannis just because they have been elite for couple year longer ,0
are they never seen that ,0
probably not but maybe some idiot will stop predicting them miss the playoff every goddamn year swear every summer it the same shit garbage team looking really good and portland will win game feel this hard because the jazz are always underrated the summer too the bad team are always better when arent actually playing game and the blazer are always worse ,0
wiggins wa the east would have made allstar team just like simmons but not comparing them wtf ,0
your take bad point arguing team defense thing goodnight ,0
kurt rambis rob pelinka jason kidd and the ghost magic johnson twitter account beyond parody ,0
bosh did not play elite defense this get parroted much but simply not true bosh played unique role but most his defensive hype wa because wa unique and that role got lot out him than before literally never even made all nba team ,0
huge difference between shooting practice and drill shooting real game reminder that dwight howard shoot ft practice also quite sure lonzo ball shooting stats are also much higher practice just mean that wait and see him actual game before judge ,0
homo ,0
multiple because wouldn call the westbrook team super team but the bull were definitely super team and never had any other allstars than and pippen the year they had horace grant and armstrong made the year when left but wouldn really count that consistent ,0

nah he still top dude sealed with ,0
idk where you got chicken tender from but now hungry and yeah isn even top wa only offence and then you getinto his lack size the defensive end had brilliant wcsf but that doesn make you top would hate see the rest the list they got undersized guard who are all bad defender the top ,0
they only after the national game thursday believe ,0
don argue then explain why based individual and team performance the past should reasonably expect philly team defence effectively contain either giannis himself the buck whole ,0
mccollum being spot away from being top player such fucking joke lmao ,0
ooouuu buurn ,0
need best ,0
and don nelson what doe have his name besides longevity ,0

dab ,0
old head don always appeal the reality situation though muggsy bogues played decade the era physicality there are guard almost big dennis rodman nostalgia paint rose colored picture ,0
have idea but doesn harden essentially never trim shorten any way that case find out couple season the answer probably yes ,0
vince carter wa always one the first player would pick any the nba game ,0
this truly the best sport shitpost ever seen usually grin fucking howling ,0
subscribed least ringer podcasts maybe even couple more bill simmons ha created juggernaut ,0
criticize the ringer lot but still listen some pod and read some article you are allowed criticize something that you like criticize the jazz when they deserve criticism too ,0
shaq ,0
obviously ,0
stop trying hard funny downvoted ,0
all kobe had wa longevity and never playing single season without enough talent make deep playoff run don undercut that legacy booster ,0
sound like dave chappelle white character ,0
they not allowed negotiate le except for buyout ,0
the picture you chose for edits are hilarious ,0
are those mutually exclusive ,0
evan fournier great player though ,0
almost good the embiid tobias boban image from earlier this offseason ,0
and yet that still le than ian mahinimi make alone this year ,0
don think should have won mvp over harden but still liked watching him play wa definitely the minority though suppose ,0
didn say anything about criticizing and you being upset the jazz are losing isn related not liking content the ringer put out ,0
check the history and the upvotes stop being hater ain healthy try have productive discussion ain troll typa guy ,0
let kelle you got this man ,0
contender chicken tender espn as dude but they def generating conversation with that list ,0
lebron did you ,0
well equate hater criticizer ,0
have and pure as for him ranked that high disrespect ,0
you remembah ,0
lycosing lol ,0
http www cbafaq com salarycap htm renegotiation can only used provide salary increase ,0
what wrong with your faaaaaccccceee ,0
honestly have idea how this happens not like there portland bias cause there really not and not even close top player and everyone know idk what exactly happened there like even the click argument doesn make much sense cause not like mccollum ha some rabid fan base anything the click are just coming from people marveling how dumb espn could possibly ,0
someone who grew never really thought much about small market team wa actually memphis list last weekend for the first time and get now wish wa there during the nba season could game ,0
some point will been the criticism with similar response about and the time played four year the league even had led team his third year the playoff one that played jimmer fredette for minute the regular season ,0
that depends what the beard think this some say harden run eveything first should good see what come that conversation ,0
wasn taj who broke derrick face ,0
why didn wanna coachable with instead pump faking free throw like dumbass still rooting for him but damn piss off that couldn make work here ,0
overturned those thing for sure play very physical and motivated defense never shy away from the moment think understandable that kinda stopped evolving his game because spent much time working basketball now love again and finding his mojo really work different aspect his game ,0
this offseason shit outta control there ha bestof for this kinda stuff ,0
yerrrrrr ,0
one asking why can le because not allowed take le unless buyout and there fucking way that getting bought out ,0
don want ever stranded island because rescued then facial hair will barely have grown out all and really patchy way too ,0
that what say ,0
oldie but goodie ,0
don know why some people hate but hope able ball out his expectation and dream sound like know what the room think him and want prove them wrong ,0
somewhat agree but think lebron knew that honestly probably would never live the hype surrounding him being dunk contest the expectation would sky high into orbit ,0
lebron and big ,0
for the year come back will lucky about starter level ,0
just curious can you refute his point mean disagree with him but this low effort comment ,0
lebron bpm vorp mvp voting round exit kobe bpm vorp mvp voting round exit ,0
this number only for the podcast sale the website sure brings it own albeit smaller portion revenue one thing thought about lot with podcasts the low cost produce them know the ringer us producer each podcast but even that isn required the host willing some the work once the podcast done you pay almost nothing since you don have host the podcast your own server you upload someone else feel like the ringer podcast system operating huge profit while the website itself the original business the company probably make far le than per employee ,0
dang bobby tell yew hwhat ,0
would prevent him from pulling straight from down low have change his shot damn feel stupid for even commenting ,0
giannis not skilled any those player but and freak nature athletically which count for something ,0
isn the best all ,0
you are correct counting stats may down wa referencing win and maybe efficiency bump from being better team with good system also chance see him the playoff ,0
gonna impeach himself ,0
you need ref get the free throw line one can take anything from you you just put the ball the bucket ,0
even your worst nba player completely bodied everyone high school and college go your head ,0
individual performance poor metric when everything about that individual circumstance ha changed additionally horford will now rather than tobi which massive upgrade defensively both and embiid are excellent defender with embiid being dpoy level with good mobility and great interior protection giannis hasn had against the two them the same team and hasn seen something similar with any kind consistency your issue that you looking individual out context and then choosing ignore the makeup our team and the situation these player changing you can talk defense without noting that our team ha gotten substantially better defensively yet you exclusively talked about losing our offense horford and jrich make for the loss offensively they just provide scoring different way shockingly now that our team ha different player will play differently you can just ignore context and talk about individual matchup though all exists vacuum either way done with you your take bad ,0
injury won let them progress ,0
this amazing ,0
giannis and brook maybe ,0
pittsburgh before tijuana ,0
realize that the thunder would have pay the entire remaining except for whatever gave like which one gonna give enough make reasonably probable happen ,0
harden bitch as game wa banned from the league the league would better good god ,0
tbh really doesn and this coming from someone whose watched every clip that came out him practicing over the last few year sure look better than did season ago when wa first discovered that his shot wa broken but there wa point late last off season when looked pretty much identical this lot fan including myself were encouraged but then slowly started deteriorate the season went and then eventually just stopped shooting ,0
calling theydidthemath ,0
they should let him just chuck preseason get him into the habit shooting three ,0
yeah but more money always nice ,0
mean generally buyout the player take le because they want leave paul can negotiate where take say mil just away again his choice sacrifice significant money leave waste away the thunder ,0
honest question how can someone love harden the way play objectively annoying and frustrating ,0
narrator they didn ,0
yeah way they win without former nfl running back kawhi leonard ,0
can someone eli what happened with this young man and his shot ,0
booker stats would definitely better the net system but better passer ,0
always gonna say the guy you played against the best cause mean you better ,0
sound like you have low mental stay ,0
also playing with luka and under rick there some good potential there say bit higher for liking but not ridiculously high least relative what wa last year ,0
argument for clearly the most dominant player the clearly best era nba talent argument against michael jordan wa pretty good ,0
ha argument lol mike for variety reason shame being second the goat guess ,0
exactly way for him pull jumper without going around his own beard with one hand which would mess his shot ,0
his buyout like that nearly double what the highest buyout ever wa and iirc that wa melo think about that double the highest ever not gonna happen ,0
totally agree ,0
yeah that good one only giannis and brogdon were thing ,0
holy shit you coming hot for sim crown aren you lol ,0
the off season more fun here than any other sport sub ,0
there also argument made that isn good thing that lost two development year and already way behind schedule his draft class ha already played two nba season and had some time make mistake and learn wa always going have develop his game and his body some the player thought ,0
thank fuck ,0
more far european don like football there used european football league defunct now ,0
yeah objective that completely feel the opposite way ,0
there eli his case man ,0
next comment ,0
for real though your team isnt bad enough good job tanking with luck bad luck you might reach the playoff ,0
realize that the thunder would have pay the entire remaining except for whatever gave like which one gonna give enough that make reasonably probable happen ,0
now imagine him play defence with that beard ,0
lot those were joke all nba defensive team kobe took lot play off defense ,0
nuance doesn exist this sub fucking hate myself for coming here everyday ,0
kyrie ate him ,0
wei wa really tall don overthink ,0
really gonna ignore the fact dude the only player lead every statistic final imo lebron the only one good enough challenge still the top but bron end his career well enough can see happen ,0
remember saying the same exact thing last off season ,0
rather mcw then kelle honestly mcw could least hold his own defense both are pretty much the same shooter ,0
this all time ,0
the same way ibaka always playing with boner give him foot extra space ,0
mean sacrificing pay and the thunder are paying for him away ffs that about half year entire salary cap ,0
kobe dfish ,0
want his mil then fine oklahoma city will pay him but don complain about wasting away the twilight year your career rebuilding team even complaining ,0
one negates the other ,0
everyday stray further from god light ,0
fuck dceu ,0
the exact same form video that surfaced late last off season truthfully ,0
well paul contract okc problem lol they traded for the end the day ,0
chasing something can catch had chance from rip because nostalgic reason also the fact that just isn good any argument you could make thrown out the window after his final performance ,0
kobe and lamar ,0
this joke how can you seriously this biased regardless whether not you agree with how can you think that ben simmons say nothing ,0
still high him easily better than least even considering that series ,0
the leg shimmy before the punch ,0
all know what cole said about him did have injury something then need rehab his shot ,0
think year old bron should defer the regular season save whatever can for the playoff ,0
bargnani wasn good but wa least serviceable starter for decade ,0
still have love for man kelle but these are empty word heard the same shit last year and got myself hyped for nothing really hope you live your potential but need see you play first ,0
calling josh richardson elite defender put you top hot take for this season ,0
harden and capela ,0
gsw ha heen linked him but ive seen warrior fan talking about ,0
damn man this great what would the all dirk nowitzki team ,0
lol this franchise get turned around will have hell lot more with lebron and vogel than with anyone else ,0
kobe won with fish with odom ,0
yeah won fmvp ,0
raptor adjusted you mean fvv shot from the last game lmao ,0
they need get their line healthy and tgeir receiver need stop dropping well thrown ball ,0
also keep mind that this would hit the thunder the luxury tax even would cost them like actually ,0
step away the internet ,0
understand why people value his longevity but magic steph nash rus oscar harden and cousy all won mvp they were voted the best player the league and stockton wa voted one the best guard twice when retired unless you want somebody for year there like point guard minimum taking before stockton ,0
superstar and role player caruso and lebron ,0
the way framed the solution his ridiculous hypothetical fucking beautiful ,0
trying lower iqe your level but right cant ,0
say andre igoudala mvp ,0
hows that comparison fair rapts were still fire without kawhi last year during reg season and now they have marc gasol with expanded role fresh off shipping the world cup ,0
take you never watched him play before ,0
discovered future mvp outside the top the draft nash curry dirk and once drafted straight all star ,0
okay whatever they pay part way with him will count against that year cap space this the information needed understand what make this difficult ,0
the time posting this comment there are week day hour min second until the season start and can come fucking soon enough ,0
roleplayer ,0
andre iguodala final mvp ,0
jeanie quietly one the worst big market owner the league ,0
lmao had bad series jordan never won playoff without pippen literally every super star ha atleast mess jordan the better scorer and way player but imo prime bron probably the best basketball player everything dude can defend like dpoy pas like get hot hit all game etc like said jordan still the goat but bron the only one challenge him and isnt even done yet the biggest thing besides the ring ha going for him the whole making the nba bigger which will always grateful for otherwise wouldnt the sport ,0
yes sends into the fucking luxury tax dude ,0
honestly could that nobody wa guarding ,0
now this big brain time ,0
thank you hakeem and david robinson are actually extremely similar yet ranking have the admiral way below hakeem ,0
international don really know this typical off season mess nephew the nephew hour ,0
agree don see why this sub are high them they underachieved the playoff ,0
know the off season but this post fucking stupid anyone could grow out their beard achieve this advantage why single out james ,0
one the best ,0
publicly but generally known that isn happy about not being contender wasn intending imply that vocally complaining ,0
that coward reason ,0
superstar and role player not two goat ,0
because doesn the only thing can really think were his roty comment which weren even bad just said thought wa favorite and wa won landslide and mitchell started that whole back and forth anyway ,0
the eastern conference final winner going determined who ha developed their jumper more simmons giannis ,0
they going fun offensively but dray gonna carrying huge weight defense ,0
they there ,0
but example his tendency not aggressive enough ,0
agree can play this league but his hype wa insane and legit warranted ha out this world athleticism but zero motor and you gave the average player his body you have freaking perennial all star ,0
initially wasn sold this idea until saw the example image ,0
his helped make miami elite the ability switch top elite team defender opinion but sure reward for their peak miami wa fast and athletic obviously wade injury mounted limited them but they were definitely super team comparison all superteams obviously you can argue many surpassed but bosh wa solid ,0
true either one really good ,0
can hear the other country announcer this gif ,0
what you think ,0
know exceeded big ben but did exceed garnett that much honest question ,0
rudy gobert joe ingles ,0
wasn playoff ,0
you already conceded that better lol need off tangent ,0
only more day offseason left ,0
moving his head constantly both vertical and horizontal plane able deny significant dimensional amount space front him allowed take charge his beard this also becomes significant defensive tool well making him true threat both end the court this his key taking back the mvp award ,0
that not how hair grows though doesn have infinite amount time the growth stage ,0
good arguements ,0
wade dude wa washed that point but still wade bron apparently almost signed during the decision year too and would bosh hadn said wanted wade bron pre mvp rose deng noah would been nut ,0
like kawhi mvp caliber and ha fmvp but start calling fmvp just mvp then run into weird shit like calling andre igoudala mvp which why ppl don ,0
well bud you got right team usa sucked as dun goofed lol ,0
too ,0
joe ingles goat not role player ,0
you guy are for ride ,0
well did draw foul with beard derozen and wa massive turning point ,0
atlanta ha much better culture than those three when come appealing nba player ,0
isn randle like like bruuhhhh ,0
just stating opinon bro you feel different all good everyone ha their own opinon like said bron the only person challenge him and aint done yet have good night bro ,0
the barbary network usually air them ,0
his for could cool what told you there wa electrifying prospect who went the draft and then forgot how play basketball ,0
were the hawk were super team ,0
hawk were willing buyout melo because they had fuckload empty cap space ,0
are you kidding this the best part ,0
visit squaredcircle sometimes haven kept with wrestling year but cool check sometimes ,0
didn ,0
anthony bennet would beg differ lol ,0
just dont see the other one giant shooting guard the other one mobile shooting big just because they both are almost unguardable with their jumper doesnt mean they similar all ,0
imo lamar odom too good and ha too well rounded skill set considered role player fit the gap between all star and role player ,0
definitely good not better individual player just ignorant say isn but you right chasing something can catch nobody will beat jordan perfect legacy ,0
mavs celtic and raptor are real possibility don see him any other superstar going after the whole fiasco ,0
guy ,0
look like lebron getting the soul sucked out him lmao ,0
when did start ,0
kobe lamar wa still far better duo ,0
yes know they only after thursday night tnt game literally never seen inside the nba the schedule here ,0
those spike got you the eye would have been bad ,0
which why have thing called context ,0
til giannis better than ,0
tim duncan well ,0
the trio probably the best even marginalises hakeem something chronic think like the trio best even ha the worst best player ,0
the logic that his beard would part his body would not risk fouling himself out very quickly every game ,0
think personally that but either way top ten still top fifteen haha ,0
doesn ,0
imo while shot would help him when the ballhandler also sometimes doe badly against organized playoff defense because inexperienced don think that the biggest issue more that offball can ignored unless the dunker position the defense give cut ,0
thought wa from the seattle area til ,0
yay guess ,0
this prop for actually saying something bold hate when bold prediction are just not universally agreed upon ,0
this low tier trolling bait ,0
could grow his beard long enough fashion into pogo stick and just launch himself from court how the fuck you gonna defend that shit ,0
petite mort ,0
got bar and that smooth baritone voice ,0
half goat half snek ,0
