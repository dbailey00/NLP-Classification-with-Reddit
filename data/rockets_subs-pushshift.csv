People usually say that MDA just makes a plan before the start of each series and sticks with it regardless of how well it pans out, without adjusting strategy, while all the other great coaches (Pop, Kerr, etc...) make the type of adjustments MDA needs to make but does not.  This supposedly limits how far his teams can go, and I‚Äôm honestly not sure what to make of it.  The way I see it there are only three ways to respond to such criticisms:

A:  take the critique as valid and cross your fingers hoping MDA changes his playoff coaching style in regards to making adjustments

B:  Deny the claim that MDA doesn‚Äôt make adjustments during playoff series and the cause of not having made a finals appearance has more to do with being outmatched as a team rather than getting out coached.

C: Accept that he doesn‚Äôt make playoffs adjustments but deny the necessity to make any adjustments in the first place, as there are plenty of championship coaches that didn‚Äôt need to make any adjustments in order to win.

Tbh maybe I‚Äôm a bit of a pessimist when it comes to MDA, but I kinda lean towards A.  From what I‚Äôve seen with MDA in the playoffs B just doesn‚Äôt fit.  As for C, I just do not know my basketball history well enough to back up the idea that ‚Äúcoming up with a plan and sticking to it‚Äù can be just as effective as ‚Äúmaking mid-series adjustments‚Äù.

Harden, Westbrook, Gordon, Tucker, Capela, 

Rivers, Green, Sefalosha, House, Chandler, Clark, Nen√™

All are fully guaranteed for at least the minimum (Nen√™ obviously has larger bonuses that will almost definitely result in him being traded away at the deadline)

McLemore, Anderson, and Hartenstein have partial guarantees and experience that give them a very large head start over the other guys for the final 3 spots.

Once we trade away Nen√™ at the deadline, we will have 14 guys on the roster and be $1,559,325 under the tax line... Enough for a pro-rated buy-out guy or to get CC3 locked up for 3 years with the remainder of our MLE.

Executives are under pressure to speak up on social issues they once avoided‚Äîlike LGBTQ rights or climate change‚Äîbecause employees, customers and investors have begun to demand it.

The decision by Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods Inc.‚Äôs CEO Ed Stack to pull assault-style weapons from shelves last year in the wake of mass shootings is held up as putting principles over profit. Rights advocates saw PayPal Holding Inc. CEO Dan Schulman‚Äôs cancellation of a North Carolina headquarters during the battle over the state‚Äôs transgender-bathroom law as a positive step.

But basketball executive Daryl Morey‚Äôs recent social-media post supporting Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy demonstrators shows there can be big costs to acting on having a corporate conscience. China‚Äôs angry reaction‚Äîand the blowback in the U.S. to the league‚Äôs response to Beijing‚Äôs ire‚Äîis a reminder that the good-citizenship business model is hardly infallible.

The trouble began moments after Mr. Morey, the Houston Rockets‚Äô general manager, hit the blue ‚Äútweet‚Äù button. Chinese fans, sponsors, broadcasters and lawmakers viewed a high-ranking National Basketball Association executive‚Äôs support of the Hong Kong protests as an assault on China‚Äôs sovereignty.

Mr. Morey deleted the offending tweet, and subsequently tweeted that he hadn‚Äôt meant to be offensive and that his comment didn‚Äôt represent the Rockets or the NBA. But the damage was done.

China‚Äôs 300 million basketball fans are highly valuable NBA assets, and growth in the country is a priority for league Commissioner Adam Silver. Chinese broadcasters, sponsors and team owners have joined the NBA family in recent years.

It‚Äôs fair to ask how an acclaimed GM like Mr. Morey could step into the hornet‚Äôs nest that everyone doing business in China knows the Hong Kong protests to be. It‚Äôs equally fair to ask why the NBA lacked a clear playbook for engaging with China.

‚ÄúWhen you wade into these politically sensitive topics, particularly in an environment you don‚Äôt understand, you‚Äôre inviting a firestorm,‚Äù said Witold Henisz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School told me this week.

Mr. Henisz, author of a book titled ‚ÄúCorporate Diplomacy,‚Äù says firms can lose hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap, revenue, legal damages or profit due to political missteps. Projects needing foreign government approval, local community support or broad consumer acceptance can be derailed by the slightest miscalculation.

For recent case studies in the U.S., look at [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc.‚Äôs inability to sway community sentiment in its bid for a New York expansion. Boston-based Wayfair Inc. took a reputational hit after selling a mere $200,000 worth of furniture to a holding facility for migrant children on the southern border.

Political complexities can be most pronounced in international markets. McDonald‚Äôs Corp. spent years and millions of dollars unsuccessfully navigating a labyrinth of Soviet bureaucracy and communist sensitivities before winning approval to open its first restaurant in Moscow in 1988. A costly miscalculation executives made early on wasn‚Äôt realizing that pitching America‚Äôs most iconic food as better than local fare was an affront to Soviet pride.

PepsiCo Inc. beat McDonald‚Äôs (and rival Coca-Cola Co. ) to the Soviet Union by mastering corporate diplomacy. It made considerable inroads after an executive convinced Richard Nixon to hand a can of Pepsi to Nikita Khruschev, the Soviet leader, during a 1959 photo op. The company risked a backlash back home amid a frenzy of anticommunist sentiment, but winning Mr. Khruschev‚Äôs heart proved a bet worth making.

Years later, Douglas Daft, who served as Coke‚Äôs CEO from 2000 to 2004, was among a generation of executives who learned from Pepsi‚Äôs strategy. ‚ÄúWe are committed to playing by the house rules wherever we do business.‚Äù That standard advice can still be found in Coca-Cola‚Äôs code of conduct.

In China, the house rules are particularly daunting. Executives have complained for years that to grow and have access to 1.3 billion Chinese, they need to put up with local partners stealing intellectual property. Companies have also had to practice self-censorship.

Last year, Marriott International Inc. fired Roy Jones, a 49-year-old social-media specialist, for liking a tweet from a Tibetan separatist group that the Chinese would find offensive. That move came as at least a dozen Western brands, including Inditex SA‚Äôs Zara apparel chain, Daimler AG and Delta Air Lines Inc., drew Beijing‚Äôs ire for similar mistakes.

Tech companies have had to make tough decisions when confronted with China‚Äôs censorship laws. In 2014, when business-networking site LinkedIn blanked out posts related to the 25th anniversary of the government‚Äôs deadly crackdown on Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, rights groups criticized it for going too far to please Beijing.

Mr. Henisz said it‚Äôs typical for organizations‚Äîincluding Hollywood movie studios and colleges‚Äîto take measures to not be seen as critical of cultures where they aim to make money. ‚ÄúHistorically, companies would keep their head down if they wanted to do business outside of the U.S.,‚Äù he said.

But this is getting harder in an era where everyone has a video camera in their pocket linked to a global social-media megaphone, he said. It‚Äôs also tougher when everyone is looking to catch companies being hypocritical or insensitive.

Swedish furniture maker IKEA Group has demonstrated how difficult finding a consistent strategy for engaging in unfamiliar territory is. The company, known for being based in a country that wears egalitarian beliefs on its sleeves, has slipped several times.

Company officials have at times apologized for missteps, such as when in 2012 it received international criticism for preemtively photo-shopping out women from some catalogs shipped to Saudi Arabia.

That same year in Russia IKEA was also criticized by free-speech advocates after it deleted a photo from its webpage showing four young people that resembled Pussy Riot, a Russian punk band critical of leader Vladimir Putin. A year later, after passage of an antigay law, the Swedish company removed an article about a lesbian couple from Russian versions of its customer magazine, saying it didn't want to break the law.

Even after all that, the company known as much for its instruction manuals as its Billy bookcases has yet to publish the definitive how-to manual for avoiding major missteps in foreign lands.",rockets,"[WSJ] 'The NBA‚Äôs Foul in China Is a Fresh Lesson in Foreign Political Risk' - Oct. 10, 2019 - by John D.

China has taken a hard stance as anti-NBA, with the Rockets currently taboo there. 

Nike has pulled all Rockets merch from China retail, games are off the air, and any support of Rockets is met with police totalitarianism. 


China has demanded total subversion, with any deviations from their ideals met with complete ostracization. 

Even though the NBA and Adam Silver have completely sucked Xinnie the Pooh off, they have still chosen to wipe all things Rockets from mainland China. 


The question is: should we continue to allow the Pro Hong Kong discussion here? 

It has at times been more talked about than the team, and could be distracting when the regular season gets underway. 


###For the unaware, the main points of contention, the why of the Hong Kong protest, are:

    The 2019 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (ELAB) Movement, are an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong which began with the aim to oppose the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and mainland China. People were concerned that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the mainland Chinese jurisdiction, undermining the autonomy of the region and its civil liberties. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, which include investigation into the alleged police misconduct and resumption of democratic reforms which are promised in the Basic Law but have stagnated since the 2014 Umbrella Revolution. The Chinese central government has described the protests as ""the worst crisis in Hong Kong"" since the handover in 1997

A Chinese version of [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tAJYARIngtg/hqdefault.jpg) would be awesome.

For those that don't know, that's the album cover for Banned In D.C. by Bad Brains, one of the most respected punk/hardcore bands of all time. They also happened to be all black, which made it even harder to book shows. The title refers to them being pretty much universally banned from every venue in their hometown of Washington DC.

So, you could do that picture but with lightning striking Zhongnanhai or something instead.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I appreciate the brutally efficient genius of James Harden and Paul isolating out of pick-and-rolls and luring suckers into cheap fouls. But pairing Harden with Westbrook‚Äôs full-speed, high-wire act makes the Rockets a lot less predictable and halfcourt-dependent, and the ref-baiting a bit less unseemly. Westbrook will also add some levity when he barges in like the Kool-Aid man to rip opponents‚Äô free throw misses out of a stunned Clint Capela‚Äôs hands.

 The point guard change will matter more in the playoffs than in the regular season, because Harden‚Äôs presence alone likely guarantees this team wins the division. Houston‚Äôs biggest pre-playoff challenge will be resisting the urge to burn him out before April in pursuit of regular-season wins, which it couldn‚Äôt avoid last season due to an unexpectedly slow start.

Unfortunately, it may not have a choice again. Houston‚Äôs starting five can play with anybody, but when the Rockets turn to the bench, quality declines quickly. Nobody else on this team would see minutes with the Nuggets or Clippers. The Rockets decimated the back half of their roster to escape the luxury tax last season, and rebuilding the bench sans assets will be no easy feat.

As for *why* they avoided the tax‚Ä¶ everyone in the league is questioning how deep new owner Tilman Fertitta‚Äôs pockets run after he reportedly took on $1.4 billion in debt to meet the whopping $2.2 billion purchase price for the team. At this point in their life cycle the Rockets should be forking out dough to cement a contender, but can they add money at all?

The team had room under the tax line and ample money left over from its mid-level and biannual exceptions to add free agents, yet it enters the season with basically five decent players. Also notable on this front: Houston reworked Westbrook‚Äôs contract payments shortly after acquiring him to be more cash-flow friendly. His deal had called for half his salary to arrive before the season‚Äôs first game annually through 2022-23. Now, half of that half ‚Äì or roughly $10 million each year ‚Äì will be paid out in regular installments over the course of each season.

On the coaching side, it‚Äôs not exactly clear what Houston hopes to accomplish after sacking half of Mike D‚ÄôAntoni‚Äôs staff and leaking some bizarre negotiations over extending his expiring contract. For now, he‚Äôll direct the Harden and Russ show, but everything about this feels tenuous. If D‚ÄôAntoni survives the season, he could be a rare ‚Äúcoach free agent‚Äù next summer.

Two young players who could help are Danuel House and Isaiah Hartenstein. The former is strong and athletic but struggled to shoot in other career stops. However, he let it fly for D‚ÄôAntoni during a productive 2018-19, sinking 41.6 percent of his 3s and scoring a three-year, $10 million deal. If he can just stay in the high 30s from deep he‚Äôs a keeper. He needs to, as he and Gerald Green are what pass for wing depth. Up front, the hunched-over Hartenstein struggles to move laterally on defense but emerged as one of the best players in the G-League last year and is only 21. He could potentially bolster a frontcourt bench that otherwise depends on whatever is left of Tyson Chandler.

One addition who may prove useful is Thabo Sefolosha. As a wing threat he probably doesn‚Äôt offer much, but if he can stay healthy, watch out for him as a smallball 4 with the second group. (Also, a Sefolosha-Capela pairing would form the league‚Äôs first All-Helvetic frontcourt!) Guard Austin Rivers returns after a bummer of a 2018-19; his massive decline in Usage Rate wasn‚Äôt offset by any increase in efficiency. To provide any value to this team, he must convert more.

The Rockets in the past have been active in-season traders building toward April, but after sending out two firsts for Westbrook and cleaning out the back end of the roster, what do they have left to trade? This front office is very skilled at working the margins and that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôll need to resort to ‚Äì hunting dark corners for castoffs, G-Leaguers and buyout candidates. The league‚Äôs ruling on the Nene contract only worsened matters ‚Äì they can play him a maximum of nine games or risk another $2.4M million cap hit that pushes them into the tax.

Sum it all up and yes, it‚Äôs been an eventful offseason, and that was before anyone tweeted about international geopolitics. Between the big-picture Westbrook-Harden pairing and the multiple small-picture issues, many questions loom. But at the end of the day, Harden is so good that Houston might win the West anyway.

So when it comes to taking a stance on China's government, of course individuals in the NBA aren't prepared to answer the many difficult questions that come with it. Questions such as:

**Is genocide bad?**

See? Not so simple anymore, is it? You can see why it's so hard for players to take Hong Kong's side over China's. Sure, the Chinese government is kidnapping and murdering Uighur Muslims en masse. But Hong Kong hurt China's feelings by not wanting to be part of that, so it's really tough.

**Are people's organs their own property?**

In spite of all the atrocities they commit, concentration camp officers need jobs too. Is it really so bad that they're kidnapping people and harvesting their organs? After all, the organs harvested from one Uighur Muslims are used to save *multiple* lives, resulting in a net increase in life. We can't possibly expect coaches to navigate the massive grey areas that come with this question. 

**Is freedom better than oppression?**

Hong Kongers are only attempting to protect their basic human rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, not getting your organs harvested against your will, etc. But how do we know for certain that China, a country known for violating all of those rights, is going to violate all of those rights? We need to give players ample time to do their own research before letting them come to their own conclusions.

As you can see, it's not nearly as simple as ""China is an authoritarian regime attempting to increase its control over Hong Kong so they can subjugate Hong Kongers"". So when players, coaches, general managers, analysts, and owners tell you that they simply don't know enough about the issue to have a stance, believe them. They totally need more than a day to form a stance on such a complicated issue.",rockets,We shouldn't expect individuals in the NBA to comment on China,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/dg21pe/we_shouldnt_expect_individuals_in_the_nba_to/,True,submission

2. Best / cheapest way to get tickets? looking at toyotacenter website, they seem pricey but understandable given it's the Clippers. Lower bowl starts at $130 up to $1000, but I'm kinda willing to pay c. $300 for great seats, which sections are the ones to target?

A trip to the Finals could potentially cause a lot of problems for the Chinese ban on broadcasting Rockets games.

There are enough fans there (largely young males, I'd bet) who surely would want to be able to watch the Finals (regardless of who was in it) such that 7 months from now when this has died down, the ban could have the unintended consequences of sowing the seeds of discontent... perhaps fueling an insurgency against government media control.

But even if the Morey's actions don't spark a Revolution, it seems like he is inspiring lots of general goodwill from average fans who may not have another horse in the race.

But since Yao is ""heated"" over the comments of Daryl, let me provide a little story...

I can't remember exactly what year this was - I think it was the 05-06' season. Calvin Murphy at that time was running basketball camps and sessions at schools throughout the Houston area and my school at the time was lucky enough to host one of them. Rumor had it that he was bringing the entire Rockets team to our school. I was super excited because what Houston middle-schooler wouldn't want to meet T-MAC or Yao.

The day came, and Calvin arrived followed by Yao, Dikembe, Rafaer Alston and Juwan Howard - T-Mac didn't make it :(

But regardless, it was awesome - to see your hometown team and the players up in person, and get to shoot hoops with them was an amazing experience. The camp kinda ended, and at this point - it was kinda like a meet-and-greet kinda deal. Players walking around talking to fans. I got to talk with Dikembe (although he was hard to understand in person haha - he was the nicest guy ever even though I was only 12 at the time and probably akward).

Me and a few friends found him walking with a security guard. We had two basketball gyms and he entered one of them that was empty. The security guard told us that he was gonna go to the bathroom first. Honestly I don't know how he managed to fit his way into the bathroom. But he knew we were gonna wait for him.

Time is a ticking - and not joking he probably spent 45 minutes in this bathroom. Must have been all that chinese food from the night before. That or he couldn't fit his body into the stalls lmao. Anyways...

Eventually he walks out of the bathroom knowing we had been waiting there for like an hour, looks at us and straight up ghosts us. At this point, there is like 4 or 5 of us (all 12-13 year olds shouting his name) - but he walks out of the gym straight to the parking lot and leaves. 

What a fuck. I get it, players are bombarded all the time by press, fans and what not. But this was a middle school camp and we were just kids.

That day forever told me who Yao actually was. A huge shitter who shatters the dreams of kids who just wanted to shake his stank hand who gets annoyed when someone has a different opinion than them.",rockets,Let me tell you why I don't like Yao Ming...,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/df6a3w/let_me_tell_you_why_i_dont_like_yao_ming/,True,submission

I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt know me but I‚Äôve been there for a year, a little bit more and I‚Äôve watched all rockets games (almost, like 90%) even if it meant missing school because I live in France and these games are at 3am in my place 

Even though I‚Äôve never visited Houston, I feel personally very hurt by what happened. As a Muslim, firstly, because you know China is killing and stealing organs to living Uighours, and of course because of what happened with Morey‚Äôs viral tweet.

I know this is nowhere near a place for political views but I see that we are all unanimously strongly against NBA‚Äôs and Rockets position in this case. 

We are the first in power to do something, this is more than a game, and our biggest star just took the choice to ¬´¬†shut up and dribble¬†¬ª even if it‚Äôs hard to admit it.

Since nobody is doing anything I think we should do something collectively, have HK t-shirts at home opening and every home game, anti China chants, I don‚Äôt know honestly I have no idea what to do but I feel like not saying anything is accepting the fact that a dictatorship can tell us how to feel and to think, and can ask for apologies if they don‚Äôt like how you think.

As everyone has seen from recent news, the NBA only cares about $$$ from the Chinese market, and the only way possible to do business with an authoritarian regime is to bend to their will. The CCP has always succeeded, simply because of the immense size of their population.

Thus, I believe we are entering unchartered territory where the outcome of Rockets games could quite negatively impact the NBA's international business. If the Chinese start seeing the Rockets succeed in the playoffs, I bet they will start calling the NBA a rigged league and boycott it entirely, which would negatively impact the NBA'S international growth.

Since the NBA's history with referee integrity is, well, murky, I believe Rockets fans need to be extra attentive to any discrepancies in in-game action with the goal of appeasing Chinese fans.

I think it ought to be good to start with a bit of background information regarding Chinese people &amp; the government's fury towards Mr Morey's tweet:

1. The definition of 'patriotism' in China varies a bit from the US - the first principle of Chinese patriotism is 'no territory should be separated'. Surely it originates from a complex set of historic and political reasons - but above all, Chinese people generally respect that and it is a part of the Chinese political correctness in China (incl. the educated middle class, if you believe there is such a thing in China).
2. Morey is definitely a master on timing - it was the midst of Chinese National Day Ôºàwhen the level of the patriotism is at peak, same as everywhere I suppose), and at the same time, Hong Kong is in a totally messed up situation and  the popular class of thought is that the Hong Kong movement is CIA backed. Naturally, Mr Morey's tweet is considered 'super provocative'.
3. As you might know Houston Rockets is THE TEAM in China because of Yao Ming. There are quite a lot of things that Chinese and Americans do not agree about - if not everything. But regarding the love to the sports and the support to Houston Rockets, I assure that the fans there are as genuine as you guys - they evaluate every step back moves of James Harden, making LBJ memes, talking shit to the Lakers fans just like you might have done. There were no politics nor nationalism involved, just sports. But when Morey posted that tweet, the fans felt that they are like idiots - the team they support does not give a shit about their feeling, esp. when the team is making tons of money from China.

The recent event in Hong Kong is a complex issue - it is not a fight between the justifiable 'democracy' and the evil totalitarianism. Believe me or not, the stories you have read about in your media (CNN, Reuters, BBC and etc.) are not much better than the so called 'propaganda stories' in the mainland China - to be honest, both sides are utterly biased. 

Personally, I understand that there is a huge gap between the values of the two countries - and I have no intention to comment on the content of Mr Morey's tweet.

He didn't do anything amazing. He simply made a mistake. Despite deleting it and offering a weak apology, it was not enough to make it blow over.

And it's not just because of the Chinese Nationalists howling for his head... It's also due to the other side being equally vocal... the slactivists shouting support for him from their armchairs like he's HK Rosa Parks when he's nothing more than a guy who made a mistake and wants it all to just go away.

The faster it goes away the faster things go back to normal, which is all anyone who doesn't live in Hong Kong really wants to happen. 

Sure the Chinese Government have a bad record when it come to human rights (*America... do you really want me to start listing things? 1. Slavery... oh I should just stop there?* *^(but there's so much more...)*). They also have the world's 2nd largest economy... none of this is going to impact them in the least... They aren't going to change their stance in Hong Kong because some Americans are suddenly more perturbed than they were yesterday.

Go get mad about something in your own country. Get mad that assault rifles are still a thing. Get mad that unarmed black men across the country are still killed en masse by the government. Get mad that the fucking President of the USA doesn't support 'Freedom in Hong Kong'  - not some sports league that has huge business interests there (the only reason the whole thing is an issue in the first place)... But just don't try to make a big deal about Morey's mistake.

The NBA and James Harden (and to a weaker degree, Morey himself), are all apologizing for the kerfuffle so that we can just move on and go back to the symbiotic relationship we enjoyed before... taking advantage of their population for our own ends... whether because they produce stuff cheaply for us (thanks to some of those human rights abuses we hate so much) or  because they consume our media (and in doing so slowly become globalized/Westernized via our soft power influence).

That's how this battle gets won. The long game. Changing minds subconsciously. Evolving the culture over time. Yelling at someone to do something they don't want to rarely yields desirable results... particularly when you have literally zero power over them.

Nothing is different in Hong Kong today than last week and nothing will change as a result of this tweet next week.

Get over it and let it blow over and if you want to help Hong Kong do something that would possibly make a difference, start taking advantages to change the ChiNat opinion to one that appreciates American influence... not is sickened by it. It's not too late to make China Great Again and fall in love with freedom for themselves. We should have learned in the Middle East that forcing things on cultures that aren't ready for them doesn't end up with the desired results.

Go tweet your feelings all you want, but don't bring Morey into it.

Before you read this article, please take a look at the following points. If you understand, congratulations, **if not, go and fuck yourself:**

First, **don't judge**; Second, everyone has the right to speak freely, but **everyone is also responsible for what they say**; Third, if you are a troll, please skip the first Fact Version, Judge Version will directly fuck you; Fourth, if you have an idea, please comment, **don‚Äôt be pussy!**

**1 Fact Version**

**1.1 The History**

**Wikipedia:** ‚Äú-The region of Hong Kong has been inhabited since the Old Stone Age, later becoming part of the Chinese empire with its loose incorporation into the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC).

\-The Qing dynasty ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire in 1842 through the treaty of Nanjing, ending the First Opium War. Hong Kong then became a British crown colony. Britain also won the Second Opium War, forcing the Qing Empire to cede Kowloon in 1860, while leasing the New Territories for 99 years from 1898.

\-Japan occupied Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945 during the Second World War. By the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops, and returned to British rule.

\-In 1984, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which incited a wave of emigration from Hong Kong. The Handover of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and it adopted the Hong Kong Basic Law.‚Äù

**1.2 Why ProtestÔºü**

**Wikipedia:** The 2019 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (ELAB) Movement, are an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong which began with the aim to oppose the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill proposed by the Hong Kong government. If enacted, the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and mainland China.

* **-Unsound Legal System:**¬†The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was first proposed by the government of Hong Kong on February 2019 in response to the 2018 murder of Poon Hiu-wing by her boyfriend Chan Tong-kai in Taiwan, where the two Hong Kong residents were visiting as tourists. Lacking a formal extradition treaty, the murderer has not been sanctioned correctly by law. And Hong Kong currently has long-term fugitive transfer agreements with 20 countries, but not China, which Hong Kong belongs to in a political sense. How ironic!
* **-Overreaction:** The Hong Kong Government stresses that this amendment applies only to the most serious crimes of imprisonment for seven years or more and does not involve basic human rights freedoms and political crimes. But the Hong Kong protesters overreacted. They hinder traffic, damage infrastructure, and harm anti-protesters. 
* **-Democracy:**¬†The protesters believe that China has no rule of law and democracy.Already 2019, why are there such stupid ideas? **Is the periodic voting game a democracy? Is lobbying and brainwashing a democracy at the time of election? Why do you monopolize the standards of democracy?** In fact, no country has the right to monopolize the standards of a democratic system, and it has no right to impose its own system on other countries. China‚Äôs democracy and the rule of law have long been distorted and misunderstood.
* **-Hong Kong independence:** The situation has now developed to the level of Hong Kong independence. Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China. Any statement that expresses or implies support for Hong Kong independence should not be tolerated! **This is as serious as discriminating against blacks in the United States! So you know why Chinese fans reacted so much to Morey's Twitter?**

**1.3 Hong Kong is China‚Äôs Special Administrative Region**

The discussion of democracy and the rule of law is very complicated. But we cannot confine our own thinking and believe that democracy is only one kind of American democracy. Based on the understanding of history, the most fundamental thing is that **Hong Kong belongs to China. This is the bottom line.**

**2.1 Morey‚Äôs Response**

https://i.redd.it/vs49j9rvh5r31.png

This is not an apology! People certainly have freedom of speech and express their opinions. It is the same in China, but they must be responsible for what they have said! &gt;!Can I say that a black person is a nigger in the United States and not responsible for it?!&lt; If your words lead to some negative effects, you must be responsible for your speech, regardless of freedom of speech or not! In addition, as a public figure, don't you know that your speech naturally represents the entire Rockets and even the NBA?

**2.2 NBA‚Äôs Response**

The value of the league support individual‚Äôs educating themselves and sharing their views on matters? &gt;!Oh God, what have they done to Sterling ( Former Clippers boss )!

First, a little about myself. 

I'm a born and raised Hong Konger, first and foremost. I have family from the mainland, but I've always identified myself as a HKer, above all other things. No one's relationship with their hometown, chosen or otherwise, is ever simple. I have my fair share of gripes and issues with Hong Kong, but it is still my home regardless. This is where I grew up, this is where my family lives, and this is where I discovered my love for basketball as a young teenager while struggling to fit in at school.

Through basketball, I discovered the NBA. Well, to be more accurate, I found Yao. I can still recall my sheer awe and amazement from seeing someone who looked like me, a lanky Chinese kid, dominate in the NBA. My love and admiration for Yao quickly made me a diehard basketball fan, but more importantly, a diehard Rockets fan. From the moment I touched a basketball, and the first time I saw those red jerseys, I was in love. 

I cannot properly articulate how much I love the Rockets. The first Rockets game I ever watched was the one where T-Mac scored 13 points in 33 seconds. My first ever basketball game was NBA Live 07, with the very same T-Mac on the cover. I've sat through year after year of injury woes to what should have been a promising dynasty, and I sat through the dogshit doldrums when our best players were Kevin Martin, Samuel Dalembert, and pre-peak Goran Dragic. I've anguished over the Rockets. I've cried, joyfully and painfully, over the Rockets. I've punched walls and dislocated fingers for the Rockets. 

Over the past several months, I've...we HKers have all had the misfortune of seeing our city plunge into chaos, uncertainty, and violence. Citizens are being beaten in the streets like dogs, faith in the establishment has completely cratered, and Hong Kong's future looks helplessly bleak. It's been extremely trying having to live through all of this turmoil, arguing with family and friends over what is ""right"" and ""wrong"". We all suffer, we all bleed, and even through all the pain we find refuge in our own ways. The Rockets, up until a day ago, was a source of such comfort for me.

I cannot even begin to express the amount of disappointment and anger I feel for the actions of Fertitta, Harden, Westbrook, and Adam Silver. Look, I'm not a fucking idiot. I understand that there are larger economic and financial circumstances that have forced the hand of those I've listed above, but those circumstances do not dull the pain their actions have caused. The Rockets' ownership and largest figures have abandoned the architect of their recent success. They have spit in the face of the freedom and expression that their country holds so dear. They have bent the knee and kowtowed to an administration that is the source of the pain and anguish my people feel every single day. 

I love the Rockets. I love the Rockets so much that even if I made an active effort to distance myself, or abandon the fandom I've held so dear for a decade, I know my heart would still ache for every loss, every stumble. I know that in my heart of hearts. The Rockets are as much a part of me as the blood in my veins. But there are things that are bigger than sports. I see the faces of my fellow HKers every day, and I also see the spit that the stars I've loved so dearly and the NBA I've followed for years have left on us. 

I would urge Fertitta, Harden, Westbrook, and Adam Silver to really pay mind to the words they've uttered, and the consequences of their actions, but they've already made it quite clear they couldn't give a fucking shit towards us. As the world continues enjoying to remind us these days, decency and sanity have their limits. I hope the money was worth the tax on their conscience. Maybe one day you'll care enough to learn about or understand our situation, but I wasn't born yesterday. I won't hold my breath for that day, and in return, you won't hold any of my cash or support.

Wanted to share one of the most upvoted response to this question ""How do the clarifying statements from NBA and Morey influence this incident?"", with Redditors who might be interested. 

I've always believed that in conflicts like this, instead of just making angry comments within one community, it brings value to better understand how/why the other side takes its stand. This is one of the more moderate reactions (instead of the more extremely nationalist answers, which don't really bring any value here). Texts in the parenthesis below are notes of my own.

Original link is from ""Zhihu"", a Chinese site similar to Quora: https://www.zhihu.com/question/349482593/answer/847926460

Disclaimer: The following is excerpted and my translation might not convey the original article in100% accuracy. 

""""""

*To understand NBA's statement, we need to first figure out ""the why"" behind it.*

*In a times of vibrant globalization of NBA, with China being its biggest partner (overseas), the public outburst and conflicts on this issue have grown explosively. The NBA however is making a superficial, ambiguous statement, trying to convert a political discussion into a cultural one.* 

*It's no surprise.*

*I never expected the NBA to issue any fines on Morey, nor will Rockets fire him even if the owner wanted to.* 

*Obviously in this issue, politics position outweighs right or wrong. For China, we have our bottom line (in diplomatic matters related to Hong Kong), while the US has its own political correctness. As the ""candle-stick"" country (this is an interesting reference to US, not sure if the context is clear. Basically it refers to the Book of Mathew in Bible and teases US for its propaganda of western values), the US has its mainstream values filled with self-assertiveness, and always tries to measure other nation's reality with their own culture and beliefs.* 

*Look at their Reddit (yup the author has VPN, as does many others netizens): considerable of American netizens voice support for Morey, just because he advocates ""democracy"" for ""people"", but without realizing Morey offended our sovereignty greatly. They think he just voices an opinion of his and what's wrong with that?*

*In reality, the so-called freedom has evolved into violence. The long-term living conditions of the ""people"" they support, the US doesn't care to understand and this is their arrogance (he's arguing that some American folks just follow the trend without really understand the issue of HK).*

*Thus, it's not hard to understand the attitude of NBA.*

*In US, as long as the bottom line of racial and sexual discrimination is not touched, it's illegal to fine people on their words because of freedom of speech. The NBA in recent years has also been encouraging their stars to comment on progressive affairs, in order to boast its own social and political value. They won't contradict themselves by punishing Morey.*

*If NBA criticizes Morey or Fertitta fires him, this will cause the public opinion to say that ""they chose money over freedom"" or ""does the NBA have the right to take away its employees' opinions?"" Granted they might fear the loss of Chinese market, but the American market is the fundamentals of NBA. It goes without saying which one is prioritized. Thus, Fertitta's saying ""We have the best GM in the league"" (This was taken out of context; I think it was wording before a turn of tone but it's taken as defense for Morey) is not because he ignores the seriousness of the issue, but it's the inevitable development of events.*

*So what's our take on this? I personally think we should stand with whatever stand the country leadership decides to take.*

*If the state does not ban NBA, it's also not necessary for us to keep bashing (Morey and NBA). Only the uncultured and the boorish shout ‚Äúperish together‚Äù to their end. The NBA is very closely knitted with China's sports industry, be it forums, media, reporters or sports company. Many count on NBA as their income.* 

*I've said this in a group chat, a nation has to protect its sovereignty to develop, but it doesn't mean pushing it too hard.* 

*I don't have the relevant numbers and stats for the sports industry, and don't have a think tank to report on cost-benefit analysis. But I trust that after a full day's silence, the State has a more accurate estimate of developments on this matter, and has planned accordingly. Whether it's forgiving concession or a heavy punch to the NBA, we shall wait and see.*

*Another way to understand this is by thinking in their shoes: if you partner with US but sends a tweet that insults African American, and try to say that ""my country has freedom of speech, and my views do not represent my company"", this most definitely won't be accepted by Americans.*

*At the end of this, one has to contemplate: under David Stern, the Houston Rockets became the barometer and milestone of NBA's Chinese market. This was why the issue was so destructive. Also, if it happened during a less subtle time (China's National Day is Oct 1st), or on a less sensitive topic (sovereignty), or a less important person (GM of the most popular NBA team in China), this matter wound't have expanded like this.*

*Perhaps, the biggest victim in this incident are the Chinese fans who devoted their love to Rockets and NBA.* 

""""""

Tl;dr: Explains why the NBA releases an ambiguous statement since it's bound by western values but still values Chinese market. Provides context of Western universal values and how it clashes with China's sovereignty issues. Urges the netizens to calm down if the Chinese leadership takes a less aggressive approach from now on, as further ban of NBA harms both sides. Explains why this particular issue exploded in  its way. 

My thoughts: 

1) The author clearly understands a fair amount of American cultural contexts, and explains on the issue from both nations' cultural and political beliefs. It‚Äòs actually a good education for the Chinese public on why the NBA/Rockets/American fans react in their ways. Hopefully this brings more meaningful conversations on this Chinese forum.

2) Has a very good point: China doesn't want to just cut ties because of conflict since China's sports industry also suffers damage if the NBA doesn't flourish in the country.

3) Emphasizes China's position is to protest against comments on its state matters. The rest of world knows how China is ""petty"" on political issues like this, but they might not really understand is that China and its netizens treats its sovereignty issues just as seriously as the west treats racial issues. Territorial integrity is its fundamental value and is indoctrinated from grade school, just as racial equality is taught in US educational system. It's a very successful strategy: *not everyone* necessarily agrees with the government's ways, but *everyone* gets fired up on territorial issues. 

4) His last sentence made me think. You can tell he really believes the Chinese fans are heart-broken by this issue, despite their angry reactions. And in a way it's true. The NBA has been a progressive, positive influence in China, and even educates the public on matters like racial equality. Fans really treat their franchise players as inspiring role models, and devote lots of emotions into the team. And now out of nowhere Morey posted this comment that's deemed outrageous in the country, and both fanbase despise each other in heated argument, with possibility of NBA being banned. There's definitely emotional loss there. 

For me, the NBA has been a great ambassador in modern China-US relationship due to its influence. It's sad to see it entangled in a position where there's no good outcome.

Morey you have my utmost respect.

How would it work if Rockets goes to the final, and still banned by China? Go Rockets!

Morey and NBA are both victims of white terror.

This is how white terror works, it is happening everywhere in Hong Kong, but now reaching the US. Back in August, a pilot of the Cathay Pacific Airlines (A Hong Kong Airline) broadcasted word of support over the speaker during landing. China then stated they will stop Cathay Pacific from flying over China's airspace (which will effectively kill the company), and demanded list of pro-democracy personnel to be provided. Under immense pressure, the CEO submitted his name only, effectively forced to resign. The pilot has since let go. With new pro-China CEO and other management taking over, not only did they changed their company policy, they recently even asked their staff to whistle blow their own co-worker, hundred since was fired. Houston Rockets banned, NBA bowed, you think this is just a single isolated case? Where the money is comes power, in a capitalist society, you obey to profit, simple as that. That's how Hong Kong people are suffering everyday, under the threats of the government, police, and large corporations, with CCP (China Communist Part) completely behind all this.

No more Chinese symbols on what is supposed to be a jersey repping the city of Houston (those jerseys were dope, but not ""city"" jerseys).

Let‚Äôs start with the fact that none of their finals MVPs are on their team anymore. That‚Äôs being forgotten. 

Over the last few years, they have gone 5-11 without Klay, and that‚Äôs with them having Iggy and KD. Steph‚Äôs greatness has always ridden on the shoulders of Iggy and Klay‚Äôs ability to hide his defensive incompetency. 

And at the end of the day, Steph is a great scorer and shot creator for himself, but he the only way he makes people around him better is by drawing defensive pressure. Which helps guys like Klay and KD get theirs, but if you‚Äôre playing the Warriors now what‚Äôs the plan? Just pressure Steph and see if anyone else on the team can beat you.

Draymond is still around, but he functions as a great glue guy on a team that moves the ball around well and sets a lot of moving screens, which there‚Äôs bound to be less of without Klay and Iggy.

My prediction is that the Warriors fight to stay right around .500 until Klay gets back, and at that point maybe rally for the 6th or 7th seed. Also, this season shines a new light on Steph‚Äôs overall lack of ability to carry a team to success on his own.

Maybe a CBA clause that states owners may lose the privileges of running the franchise if they act in extreme opposition to the fans and the game of basketball.  This would only come in to play if ownership fires someone like Morey in this instance, or does something flagrantly against good basketball such as trading Harden for Andrew Wiggins or something like that.

Or maybe just move to a model where franchise owners act more like like limited partner or investor in the franchise, whereas right now they are more like sole proprietors,

Heck maybe get rid of the owners all together and move to a model where the NBA franchises are publicly traded (with stipulations such as being a US citizen residing and paying state and local taxes where said franchise is located).  And value of shares is strictly tied to a formula that only takes into account regular season wins and losses along with playoff success or lack there of.

It was a pretty sad day for me in the last 24 hours. I don't wanna see these dramas happen in Rockets org and these dramas have nothing to do with sports and athletes, however, it happens.

First things first, don't ask me is Hong Kong part of China. To me, this question is equal to what I'm asking you is Alaska part of the US. So I have no comment on Daryl Morey's tweet.

In the last 10 years of Rockets history, Daryl did an absolutely amazing and awesome job! Brought up James Harden, built a franchise around him, team up with CP3 last two years, and Russ this year. As Rockets fans, we couldn't ask more.

So back to the topic, after Daryl's tweet, the response from the Chinese government and media comes in 24 hours. All commercials and cooperation between China and Rockets have suspended immediately, the broadcasting of Rockets games in China is banned too including Home and Away games.

I guess this tells us one thing at least: **every behavior has a consequence**. Darly's tweet is a behavior, and the Chinese government's response is a consequence.

As a business league NBA, and Rockets org, I think if they want to run business in some foreign countries, compliance is necessary, and to obey the local law. Here are two examples happen in China:

1. Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones in China. In order to comply with China's law which the government asks internet companies to store Chinese users' data in China territory, so they can have censorship on user's data, Apple built a data center in Guizhou, China to store all Chinese user's data. In this way, Apple still makes lots of money from the Chinese market.
2. On the other side, Google is a totally opposite example. Google doesn't want to have censorship on Google users' data, so Google quits the Chinese market, and also gets banned by the Chinese government. (Same story on Facebook)

**I love democracy and freedom**, but I still know the definition of democracy in each country might be different and vary. However, **sports shouldn't get involved in politics**. As a public figure, GM of a sports team, it's really inappropriate to make these comments publicly. I bet Daryl won't post that tweet if he knows the consequence is so much serious. But it happens, let's see how NBA league responses to Daryl's behavior.

*My final thought*: I don't wanna see Daryl gets fired, there is no GM better than him in the current market. He has done so many contributions to Rockets in the last 10 years, and we can't afford to lose him.",rockets,"As a 10+ years Chinese Rockets fan living in US, here are some thoughts of mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/deazlv/as_a_10_years_chinese_rockets_fan_living_in_us/,True,submission

**Rockets**

‚Ä¢ Everyone wonders if swapping Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook makes the Rockets better or worse. My boring take: They are about the same -- a really good team that probably isn't going to win the title. The trio of Westbrook, James Harden and coach Mike D'Antoni is talented and creative enough to paper over Westbrook's busted jumper, but only so much. You never know what the backup wings and bigs are giving you night to night. An injury to P.J. Tucker is death against LeBron and Leonard.

But the Rockets don't get enough credit for being the only Western Conference team to compete at all with the Durant-era Warriors. Those Warriors are the only team to beat Houston -- or really even trouble them -- in the playoffs since the Rockets paired Paul and Harden. The Westbrook/Harden/Eric Gordon/Tucker/Clint Capela grouping should be a championship-level closing lineup.

Houston deserves to be grandfathered into the top tier. I am a little afraid of what hard-chargin' Tilman Fertitta might pull in the event of a slow start. He could fire everyone and install himself as GM, coach, and head chef. He could also mandate the kind of nutty all-in trade (R.I.P. Nene contract) that fortifies the 2019-20 Rockets even if it hamstrings the team's future.

Personally,  I'm thinking we need guys who can run with Russ, as well as guys who can help space the court.  So I'm thinking he could run with a true bench unit of Rivers, Green and House. And then (for boxing out purposes) Chandler at center. 

This will allow Harden to play with Capela and Gordon more, which helps because of the effectiveness of the Harden and Capela pick and roll, and then the spacing Gordon gives, as well as Gordon being able to guard the best wing so that Harden doesn't have to.

According to [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/games/20191004/HOULAC#/matchup), it'll be broadcasted on FSW which is the Clippers local channel, and NBA TV which will be obviously using their feed.

General manager Daryl Morey caught up with a group of media in the lobby, chatting about the summer‚Äôs activities ‚Äî yearning for a longer vacation, but eager to get things going.

James Harden and Russell Westbrook posed for the cameras on the second floor, Westbrook still taking in the new environment and not the one he‚Äôs known for over a decade.

Tyson Chandler, in his mighty 7-foot-1 frame, squeezed into a tiny chair to do his first of many radio hits with the flagship station. Ben McLemore descended the steps, beaming in his new jersey. Ryan Anderson talked about his business ventures and the recent birth of his son, Carter. Young big man Isaiah Hartenstein teased a certain writer for *The Athletic* about his lack of an available turtleneck, with said writer opting to take the high road.

The local media, along with some national attendees, sat eagerly in the press conference room, happy to see old friends and new acquaintances. It was almost like the first day of school.

Head coach Mike D‚ÄôAntoni and Morey entered the room and took their seats at the podium, with D‚ÄôAntoni professing his undying love for the game, how fun it is to be part of such an entity and the competitive nature that next season will bring.

When asked about the prospect of bringing two high usage players together in Harden and Westbrook, D‚ÄôAntoni stressed that it will work itself out.

‚ÄúYou try not to coach it too much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need Russ to be Russ. He‚Äôs an MVP. Of course there will be some things we‚Äôll have to push left or right, but we‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù

To the coaching staff, the most important aspect of bringing the pair together will be figuring out how the last five minutes of the game will go, X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs wise, the other three players that will be on the floor alongside the backcourt, and how halfcourt situations will play out.

Of course, D‚ÄôAntoni is aware this is the last year of his own deal, with negotiations over his future breaking down during the summer. Nevertheless, it won‚Äôt be a distraction. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to coach this team,‚Äù D‚ÄôAntoni said.

It‚Äôs understood that nothing on that end will be dealt with now and that talks will reconvene in the summer. Morey stated he ‚Äúsees D‚ÄôAntoni here long-term,‚Äù and they‚Äôll work it out over the season. Team owner Tilman Fertitta echoed the sentiment, saying D‚ÄôAntoni is ‚Äúthe right guy for the team.‚Äù

Fertitta wishes those contract talks didn‚Äôt play out so publicly in the manner that they did, but both sides know that it will be handled privately moving forward.

### Tyson Chandler wasn‚Äôt just brought in for his skillset

After Clint Capela‚Äôs poor playoff showing against the Warriors, the team‚Äôs veterans made it one of their goals to support and work with the Swiss center. Admitting the series ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt easy‚Äù for him, over the summer he watched film, worked on his body and improved his game playing with his national team. Capela said he wants to ‚Äúdominate more on both ends of the floor,‚Äù hoping to take strides in offensive and defensive rebounding, running the floor and finishing around the rim.

In Chandler, the Rockets add an experienced, savvy, big who has been around the league for almost two decades. Chandler said his job is to make the other guys around him comfortable. Spreading a defensive culture in the locker room, making sure no one feels isolated and stressing communication are his biggest contributions.

Harden and a few others lauded the addition of Chandler for the role he‚Äôll play in mentoring Capela. Having been there and done that, as far as personal accolades (Defensive Player of the Year) and team accolades (NBA championship with Dallas) go, Chandler will be a calming presence for Capela. He‚Äôs there to aid in his continued development en route to becoming an elite defensive presence and anchor for a team D‚ÄôAntoni wants to place in the top 5.

### Houston hopes to have shored up its rebounding issues

After finishing 27th in team rebounding last season, the front office and coaching staff knew this needed to be addressed. Time after time in the playoffs the Rockets were burned on that end. In what looks to be a dogfight every year, they can‚Äôt afford to give teams like Golden State and Utah extra possessions.

The additions of Westbrook, Chandler and signing of Danuel House are necessary steps to fixing that problem, according to D‚ÄôAntoni. Westbrook, who led all guards in the NBA in rebounds with 11.1 per game, will certainly help in that aspect.

‚ÄúHis presence pushes my energy even more, just by being here,‚Äù Capela said.

It‚Äôs a different dynamic opposed to having a guard like Chris Paul, an elite playmaker but one who doesn‚Äôt possess Westbrook‚Äôs physical qualities.

In similar aspects, House will be able to use his size, strength and speed to contribute whether he starts or comes off the bench, as D‚ÄôAntoni said Eric Gordon is the starter for right now. For years, Chandler has been one of the league‚Äôs best offensive rebounders, using his trademark tapbacks as a means to give his team extra possessions and tire out defenses.

### Health will be as big a factor as ever

As Austin Rivers answered a question about his offseason, stating it was the first summer ‚Äúwithout any health problems,‚Äù he knocked on the table almost immediately, in an effort to not jinx his good fortunes. Nagging elbow issues have plagued him during previous summers, making him unable to practice and train to the extent he would desire.

This Rockets team will be one of the oldest in the league, especially after bringing Nene back and signing Chandler and Thabo Sefolosha. On the subject of rest, D‚ÄôAntoni joked that ‚Äúyou can rest in May if you don‚Äôt make the playoffs,‚Äù but there is already a plan in place for load management, the much-debated topic of the offseason.

Westbrook was recently cleared to partake in five-on-five activity, and he assured his health is fine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ready to go by opening night,‚Äù he stated.

Nene will not participate in training camp because of a re-injured adductor, the team announced Friday morning.

Chandler has dealt with some injuries the past few seasons, with neck stiffness being a problem for him in 2018, but he appears set to go for camp. The same can be said of P.J. Tucker and his ankle injury suffered in Team USA camp.

Just how much load will be managed? This is one to watch over the season, given Harden‚Äôs ironman mentality, Westbrook‚Äôs minor knee issue and the advanced ages of most of the rotation.

### Other notable sights and sounds

* Gerald Green might have won the award for quote of the season, and there hasn‚Äôt even been a preseason tipoff yet. Speaking about Westbrook‚Äôs intensity, Green said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two types of dogs in this world: cage dogs and purse dogs, and Russ damn sure ain‚Äôt no purse dog.‚Äù
* Another close challenger for quote of the day came from James Harden, when asked about how much attention he paid to offseason moves: ‚Äú‚ÄúI paid attention when Paul George left. That means Russ is available.‚Äù
* Is there more importance to a fast start this season? Houston will want to avoid last season‚Äôs 4-7 early funk, and D‚ÄôAntoni seems aware of the heightened challenge. While acknowledging fellow title challengers in the Clippers, Lakers, Nuggets, Jazz and Blazers, he also mentioned teams like Dallas, Sacramento, and New Orleans as teams that can sneak up on them.
* Eric Gordon is the starter, but that battle between him and Danuel House is one to watch during the preseason.
* What roles Sefolosha and Anderson figure to play during the season is still unclear. D‚ÄôAntoni stated he plans to operate with a 10-man rotation. So far, Harden, Westbrook, Gordon, Tucker, Capela, Rivers, House and Green can be locked in.",rockets,"'Tyson Chandler‚Äôs wisdom, knocking on wood and rebounding solutions: Takeaways from Rockets media day' by the Athletic's Kelly Iko",https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/dai3z7/tyson_chandlers_wisdom_knocking_on_wood_and/,True,submission

In somewhat ironic fashion, the knockout punch the Rockets suffered during last season‚Äôs playoffs came at the hands of the one thing Houston hasn‚Äôt had in the James Harden era: a playmaking forward.

Time and time again in the fourth quarter of Game 6, Steve Kerr ran the same play ‚Äî a side Draymond Green-Steph Curry pick-and-roll‚Äî and the Rockets had no answer for it.

Season	Player	Assist/G
2018-19	P.J. Tucker	1.2
2017-18	Trevor Ariza	1.6
2017-18	P.J. Tucker	0.9
2017-18	Ryan Anderson	0.9
2016-17	Trevor Ariza	2.2
2016-17	Corey Brewer	1.1

It‚Äôs been said that this Rockets team was built specifically to beat Golden State. Having been eliminated from the playoffs by them two seasons in a row, perhaps the one piece that was missing was the most important. Whether because of personnel or preferred style of play, there hasn‚Äôt been much playmaking help in the frontcourt.

So why was this never addressed? Part of it is simply due to the brilliance of Harden. For the past two years, coach Mike D‚ÄôAntoni was comfortable with having one lead playmaker on the floor at all times ‚Äî Harden or Chris Paul. With assists, comes usage. In the past three seasons, Harden‚Äôs usage rate has steadily increased; 34.2%, 36.1, 40.5. He‚Äôs also generated at least seven assists or more for the past five seasons; in short, efficient production and consistent results.

While this brought offensive success in the regular season and opening rounds of playoff basketball, when the going got tough ‚Äî like the Warriors mounting a comeback ‚Äî Houston‚Äôs title hopes essentially lay square on Harden‚Äôs shoulders, with him having to make a play virtually every time down the floor.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. General manager Daryl Morey‚Äôs forward-thinking, advanced-math ways are rooted in efficiency. That said, there‚Äôs a middle ground that exists between lessening Harden‚Äôs load moving forward and maintaining the team‚Äôs offensive balance.

When the league‚Äôs top defenses prepare to face Houston, they‚Äôll know that a large chunk of the game will be accounting for just one elite playmaker. That makes it easier to scheme for, knowing that either Harden or Russell Westbrook will carry the brunt of usage and creating for others. The presence of a forward who can create plays for others forces the defense to be on its toes and eases the load on Harden and Westbrook.

Normally, you would have to look outside the roster and hope to acquire one in a trade or free agency. For next season, that answer might already be in uniform in Danuel House Jr.

*‚Äú(Danuel House) is going to be very important. We have to have that athleticism on the wing. We did not have it last year. He‚Äôs going to have a big role, whatever it is.‚Äù‚Äî D‚ÄôAntoni*

If you live and die by Basketball Reference statistics, you won‚Äôt be too encouraged by House‚Äôs 1.0 assists per game, but fear not for three reasons: sample size (about half of a season), usage rate and role within the offense.

For starters, the ball wasn‚Äôt in his hands an awful lot. A usage rate of 13.7% for House puts him in line with forwards like Danny Green (13.9), Semi Ojeleye (13.7) and Portland‚Äôs duo of Maurice Harkless (13.5) and Al-Farouq Aminu (13.4).

Players like this usually get the bulk of their offense in two ways: in transition or catch-and-shoot opportunities. In his 39 games with the Rockets last season, the team played to his strengths. House‚Äôs 1.36 points per possession in transition put him in the top 10 percent among his peers. But teams don‚Äôt just score in transition for 48 minutes. The majority of the time ‚Äî 48.3% to be exact, per Second Spectrum ‚Äî House would spot up on the wings or in the corner.

We often speak of gravity as it pertains to otherworldly shooters like Curry and Klay Thompson, but there‚Äôs a different kind that applies to Harden. When he drives, all attention shifts towards him and temporarily away from those spaced around the floor. House‚Äôs 187 passes received from Harden were his most frequent amongst the team, and he shot an impressive 45.3% on perimeter shots resulting from this. A lot of possessions would end like this.

If House is so good at this, why divert from what‚Äôs working?

I often found myself answering this question when I watched him play in the NEX Pro League this offseason, a Houston pro-am. I watched every game, every possession of his. It wouldn‚Äôt have been considered out of the norm for House to score 30, 40 points per game. What was more fascinating was watching him operate in the half-court setup, directing traffic, handling the ball and creating scoring opportunities for teammates less skilled than himself, particularly in drive-and-kick situations.

‚ÄúThroughout the years we‚Äôve worked on drive and kicks, as well as other passing (aspects) and relocating,‚Äù trainer Kenny Ellis said. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, Danuel‚Äôs IQ is pretty high.‚Äù

House had the fifth-most assists (3.5) amongst all players in the NEX Pro League, placing second among forwards. Once again, sample size matters, but his offseason output (15 games, 22.8 ppg) aligns pretty nicely with his previous G-League timeshare with the Vipers (18, 20.7, 3.7 assists) with more time on the ball (24.5% usage).

**Film Room**

Glancing back at Houston‚Äôs roster and House‚Äôs pass distribution, these four stood out. The high-shooting percentages of Gerald Green, Austin Rivers and P.J. Tucker speak to the team‚Äôs mission statement and House‚Äôs drive-and-kick ability, while Clint Capela‚Äôs 71.4 field-goal percentage off his passes is ridiculous.

Pass To	Freq %	# of Passes	Assists	FG % (3P for non-center)
Capela	6.4	43	10	71.4
Green	3.4	23	7	50
Rivers	8.9	60	4	45.5
Tucker	4.2	28	4	60
The sample size police will be in full attendance, but this efficiency simply cannot be ignored. Houston rewarded House‚Äôs season with a three-year deal and should look to trust him more with the ball in his hands.

Here, Dario Saric must respect his 3-point marksmanship and forces his hand. House uses his pump fake and nifty Euro to split him and Robert Covington, fake out three Wolves defenders and complete a wrap-around pass to Capela ‚Äî all within three seconds. We‚Äôre not even talking about Harden-like gravity; a tertiary playmaker need not possess that same draw, he just must be comfortable enough making plays off the dribble for the defense to respect it.

‚ÄúHe does the little things,‚Äù Ellis said while watching this replay. ‚ÄúHe watches film constantly. I‚Äôve been on FaceTime with Danuel after games, where he has gone straight home and immediately re-watched the game he just played in.‚Äù

Work smarter, not harder. Westbrook and Harden don‚Äôt have to do the heavy lifting every time down the floor if someone else can shoulder some responsibilities. According to Morey, Houston has some plans in place for load management for his MVP backcourt, during games and throughout the season.

Again, Davis Bertans has to respect House‚Äôs ability to shoot, and he isn‚Äôt quick enough to keep up with him on the drive, forcing help to come from the weak side. Immediately after giving House the initial pass, Green repositions himself on the wing, knowing House will drive and kick. He somehow manages to whip a one-handed pass to a wide-open Green, albeit a tad high, but with more than enough time to gather himself and shoot.

This is one of House‚Äôs favorite plays, and his excitement is apparent rewatching the clip. ‚Äú(I‚Äôm) just trying to make the right read,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTrying to get someone else a good look since help came over!‚Äù

Houston doesn‚Äôt need House to become the next Ben Simmons or Draymond Green; what he brings to the offense already fits like a glove. But a few more opportunities with the ball in his hand and trust given to make plays could add another layer to the Rockets‚Äô offense and go a long way to keeping Harden and Westbrook fresh for the biggest tests down the road.",rockets,‚ÄòHow Danuel House can solve Houston‚Äôs frontcourt playmaking problem once and for all‚Äô by Kelly Iko of the Athletic,https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/comments/d9vuzp/how_danuel_house_can_solve_houstons_frontcourt/,True,submission

It's weird to think that a guy who averaged a triple-double each of the past three seasons has something to prove. But after a trade to Houston -- which cost the Rockets Chris Paul, two first-round picks in 2024 and 2026, and two pick swap possibilities in 2021 and 2025 -- Westbrook has to show that he was worth that haul. He has reunited with buddy James Harden, but will it be enough to get Houston over the top and into the NBA Finals? 

**Royce** **Young:** Westbrook isn't a top-10 player anymore, apparently. This is not necessarily a disagreement, but not giving him the label of ""top 10"" feels a bit jarring, especially considering he's riding a three-season streak of averaging a triple-double. Westbrook had a ""down"" year last season in the way only he can -- massively productive across the board but with bad shooting and low efficiency. So in a new situation with the Rockets and with age becoming a looming threat, he'll have some motivation this season. As if he needs any more. 

**Tim Bontemps:** Irving and Westbrook. The two star point guards both famously changed teams this summer. \[...\] For Westbrook, being traded to Houston and again playing alongside Harden will allow him to prove either that he can adjust his game to fit around others or that he never will do it.
